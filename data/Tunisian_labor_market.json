As a leader, you’ll be constantly challenged to pinpoint what will matter next. Once you fgure that out, then comes the challenge of deciding how to lead through it. There’s no doubt that disorienting times need critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity and the ability to communicate effectively. But there are new skills you’ll need to navigate our messy future. In The 2025 Skills Horizon report, we explore those skills, the benefts they unlock and how you can stay ready for anything. Our agenda for the report is ambitious:\n\n+ We start by unpacking how the world is changing. Namely, we focus on the fve shifts—the values shift, the technology shift, the accountability shift, the trust shift and the energy shift—that will make it more diffcult than ever to lead. These shifts will cause fractures, complexity, uncertainty. But they’ll also spawn more ideas, more creativity, more innovation. While the future is messy, it’s also flled with opportunity. + Then we dive into how we built the 2025\n\nSkills Horizon. We looked, we read, we reviewed, we talked, we listened. This is a different kind of report. One of the main differences is\n\nthat we conversed with more than 70 global and Australian leaders and executives across various felds. And when we say “various”, we mean it: inside, you’ll see insights and wisdom from heads of government and head chefs alike. + After breaking down the numerous practical\n\napplications of the report—from using it to create a shared vocabulary across your organisation to citing it at dinner parties as a way to impress guests— we zoom in on the skills themselves. We start by stepping you through the three types of skills that stood out from our research (Amplifiers, Big Movers, Unexpected Emergers). That’s followed by Blobs, which represent four areas of skills convergence that will demand your attention over the next decade (Speaking the Language of tech, Solving problems of scale, Working across difference, Thinking through complexity). Don’t let the cute name fool you—this section will be key in planning your leadership trajectory. + To close, we explore the traits and habits of\n\nThe Curious Leader, an archetype for leadership success in 2025 and beyond. The 2025 Skills Horizon is a dynamic guide that’ll help you and your team stay prepared for what’s ahead. Happy upskilling. 7\n\nT h e 2 0 2 5 S k\n\ni l l s H o r i z o n\n\nE x e c u t i v e o v e r v i\n\ne w\n\n“ First there is the\n\nchallenge and the necessity of a shared reality to take meaningful action to solve problems.”\n\nSaul Perlmutter Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist\n\n“ Our leaders are going to have to be much more human than they were previously, much more caring and more innovative.”\n\nDavid Gonski AC Chancellor, UNSW\n\n“ It is increasingly important\n\nto remain outwardly focused while stripping out all the noise. Leaders must keep asking themselves what really does matter.”\n\nIan Narev CEO & MD, SEEK\n\n“ AI can be a form of\n\nexistential challenge, not only to what you're doing, but how you view yourself.”\n\nRobert Thomson Chief Executive, News Corp\n\n“Strategic vision will be critical not just for founders but for\n\nexecutives across the board. Just being good at operational execution will no longer be sufficient. Executives and leaders will need to have much deeper understanding of technology and how to apply it to their business model.”\n\nNickle LaMoreaux Chief Human Resources Offcer, IBM\n\n“ You have to be boundary\n\nbreaking and rule breaking and put trust in your imagination to take you into the unknown.”\n\nKip Williams Artistic Director, Sydney Theatre Company\n\n“ I think there is a greater degree of ambiguity and nuance in the world. Even just looking at the use of Gen AI and its use in any organisation, the opportunities and challenges that Gen AI creates. On the one hand there are all the benefits that Gen AI can create - and then there are the issues like privacy and ethical issues. You need to stare into these challenges and work through them to determine what is the right position for your organisation. Being able to live with ambiguity is extremely important.”\n\nDavid Thodey AO, FTSE Chancellor, The University of Sydney\n\n8\n\n“I think that all democracies will end up having some form of AI regulation in the next maximum two-three years.”\n\nDragoş Tudorache Member of the European Parliament and\n\n“ Leaders face heightened\n\nregulatory and stakeholder demands, requiring stronger focus and better skills to manage, engage and communicate with a broader range of stakeholders.”\n\nChair of the Special Committee on AI\n\nMark Rigotti CEO & MD,\n\nAustralian Institute of Company Directors\n\n“ There is great variation between countries and regions when it comes to hybrid work. Leaders will have to figure out what this will do to company culture, the sense of belonging to a company, to learning and upskilling, the ability to learn from others, and even productivity over time.”\n\nMorten Wierod CEO, ABB\n\n“ There is a growing sense of policy complacency, where we\n\nknow what the real issues are, and we are acutely familiar with the challenges that the country is facing into. And yet we’re not taking the big policy steps that are needed in order to address those challenges.”\n\n“ The pace of change has escalated so much with the acceleration of digital change and changes brought on by AI.”\n\nBran Black Chief Executive, Business Council of Australia\n\nFiona Allan CEO, Opera Australia\n\n“ I think we're going through a period, driven by a whole series of factors, like the failure of the liberal market ideology to deliver equitable outcomes as it promised to do. It’s made things better, but the rising inequality is a sign of its failure on that front, the large potential displacement of the middle class by new technologies and things like that.”\n\nDr Simon Longstaff AO Executive Director, The Ethics Centre\n\n9\n\nThe next 10 years will be the most disorienting of your career. They could also become the most impactful. 10\n\nOur messy future\n\n5 things to worry about... The next 10 years will be the most disorienting of your career. They could also become the most impactful. The world is already marked by disruption and growing uncertainty. Next come deep fractures and complexities. The fractures and complexities manifest in fve important shifts: the values shift, the technology shift, the accountability shift, the trust shift, the energy shift. They can’t be avoided."

        "You might be able to minimise their impacts, but they will all require adaptation. In times of uncertainty and complexity we tend to trace what is neatly and clearly demarcated: visible megatrends or narrow technology trends that extrapolate technological possibilities. This can narrow our feld of view, obscuring the fact that the most destabilising impacts and the biggest opportunities come at the intersection of the technological, the social and the political. The next decade is all about messy shifts. Here are the fve things to worry about:\n\n“ The truth is no longer the truth. It’s much more difficult to agree on facts. Beliefs replace facts and truths, and opinions become the new truth. One of the most difficult challenges for leaders, especially in a global organisation, will be how to manage this when creating a narrative that can bring people together.”\n\nMorten Wierod CEO, ABB\n\n01 The values shift\n\nFractured values and fragmenting expectations\n\nOur organisations face unprecedented diversity. Multiple generations, each with different values and work expectations, coexist in our workforce."
    ],
    [
        "This internal shift mirrors broader societal changes, demanding that you engage with a wider range of stakeholders both inside and outside your frm. Demographic trends, economic pressures and improved healthcare have created a multigenerational workforce, with each cohort shaped by distinct sociopolitical experiences. Together, we’re pursuing gender, cultural and ideological diversity. But we’re entering a moment of fragmentation: shifting political norms and changing values bring new fault lines, even in previously unifed groups. The attitudes of young men and women are polarising; young men are more conservative than young women. What work means to them, what careers are, what they look for in a leader, how they relate to each other, and what they expect from their organisation and government is changing. The implications for you are both subtle and profound. How do you maintain cohesion amidst such plurality? Will productivity suffer or soar? How do you manage diverging expectations of where, when and how to work? How do you harness differences while working towards inclusion to create a true sense of belonging? 11\n\nT h e 2 0 2 5 S k\n\ni l l s H o r i z o n\n\nO u r\n\nm e s s y\n\nf u t u r e\n\n“ Technology can mutate in ways\n\nthat are corrosive to culture, and become catalysts for bad behaviour. CEOs have to continuously scan technologies for social and cultural challenges that can emerge.”\n\nRobert Thomson Chief Executive, News Corp\n\n“ Technological progress has never been faster. The great acceleration we are witnessing, the extremely rapid pace of digitalisation, creates a wealth of opportunities, but also creates a world of challenges. There are significant uncertainties about how emerging technologies will continue to affect our economies and societies.”\n\nRafał Kierzenkowski Head of the Strategic Foresight Unit,\n\nOffce of the Secretary-General, OECD\n\n02\n\nThe technology shift Strategic necessities with no clear direction\n\nTechnology has never been as indeterminate and open-ended as it is now. It’s flexible, with seemingly endless opportunities to reshape business, healthcare and society. But technology is also compulsory. Avoidance is not an option. You have to fgure it out."

        "What will it mean for your business model? How about your personal productivity? How will it change your customers’ habits? How will it be regulated? Data, AI and cyber conversations are happening at every level of your organisation, and ensuing transformations will run from the front line to the board level. At the same time, technology is changing society more broadly. As these conversations move out of IT and into the C-suite, they directly impact strategy, operating models and growth. We’re entering a rapidly evolving period. While the building blocks have emerged (vast amounts of data, AI and democratised generative AI, new hardware and energy dependencies, new internets, the way they ft and evolve together has not. You have to interpret technology. Everyone is now in R&D. If we take assistive thinking, which is our ability to augment human intelligence, tasks and organisational processes, this could unlock more productivity and creativity, as well as new abilities. So while AI might not be coming for your job, it’s coming for your job description. Synthetic reality—everything from AI-generated text, voice and video to sales agents, virtual influencers or digital team assistants—will permeate all aspects of our lives. The machine will look like, sound like and behave like us. Synthetic possibilities will challenge our business models as much as they’ll challenge our education systems and our democracies. From our companies and our universities to ourselves, this technology shift will change us. 12\n\nT h e 2 0 2 5 S k\n\ni l l s H o r i z o n\n\nO u r\n\nm e s s y\n\nf u t u r e\n\n“ Food is, by far, the most important thing in the world. It's what makes us healthy. It's also what makes us unhealthy. How we grow food makes the planet healthy or unhealthy. It's as simple as that."

        "And the key to all of this is making people understand more what food is, where it comes from, who are the people behind it. Provenance tracking is a way to really increase value.”\n\nRene Redzepi Chef & Co-Owner, Noma\n\n“ With the increase in new regulatory obligations in markets like the European Union, organisations have to shift from ‘story telling’ to ‘story proving’. To ‘prove’ their products and services, they have to collaborate with others, both upstream and downstream from them, in order to collect evidence and trusted data to maintain compliance and access to those markets.”\n\nLaszlo Peter CEO, KPMG Origins\n\n03\n\nThe accountability shift Accountability across boundaries and the provenance economy\n\nWe need to rethink accountability. Sustainability, decarbonisation, regulation and the new geopolitics require a shift of perspective from the organisation to the systems level. And as the world reaches the limits of its social and environmental ecologies, provenance, tracking and tracing become crucial. The questions of How was it made?, By whom?, Under what conditions and regulatory regime? and What will become of it?"
    ],

        "are becoming a central concern. All businesses must respond to sustainability and regulatory demands: tracking the provenance of materials in their supply chains; the scope and volume of their carbon emissions; and the impact of their products on the natural, social and economic worlds. This includes an awareness of the full scope of the supply chain; creating products that are free of modern slavery; and the centring of ESG concerns in order to calculate and reliably report on their footprint for sustained market access. Governments and regulators increasingly seek full proof of the provenance of materials and products. And consumers are more and more conscious of their impact on the environment and society. That means they seek more information not only about the origins, materials and manufacturing processes behind the products they purchase, but also the values and ethics behind the services and technologies they use. There are new opportunities in this shift: for strong partnerships with government, suppliers and competitors across the value chain; to enter new markets; and to decrease costs (for instance, through re-use and energy effciency). “ Being alive to policy, understanding its impact on your business,\n\nbeing intimately familiar with the people and the decision-makers, and having an understanding of how best to engage is key.”\n\nBran Black Chief Executive, Business Council of Australia\n\n13\n\nT h e 2 0 2 5 S k\n\ni l l s H o r i z o n\n\nO u r\n\nm e s s y\n\nf u t u r e\n\n“ There is an erosion of confidence and\n\ntrust in business and public institutions. We, the leaders of these very powerful organisations that have shaped and continue to shape society, need to stop and think. Do we actually deserve people's trust? Are each of our actions building or depleting our right to operate and innovate? Are we acting ethically?”\n\nNick Leeder Vice President, Customer Solutions, Google APAC\n\n“ With digitisation comes\n\ncommoditisation of certain products and markets. Therefore, reputation, trust and communication play a critical role for people in building relationships with customers.”\n\nAntony Shaw CEO, HSBC Australia\n\n“ We’re entering a more volatile period where we need our public institutions and other social institutions to work as automatic stabilisers. They have a stabilising role in public decision making in society, ensuring that they don’t amplify any big movements and instability. This is especially important as a counter to amplification through social media, fragmentation, misinformation and disinformation.”\n\nDr Gordon de Brouwer PSM Australian Public Service Commissioner\n\n04\n\nThe trust shift The erosion of trust in institutions, ideas and geopolitical stabilities\n\nThe foundations of trust are shifting. New instabilities have brought into focus its normally invisible foundations: taken for granted principles, institutions, relationships and norms. In the year when more democracies voted than at any time in human history, trust in traditional institutions and enduring ideas like liberal democracy are in sharp decline. And there are more eyes than ever on the role of businesses, their legitimacy and their social licence to operate important services and systems in and for society. Taking on these responsibilities requires trust, which has to be earned continuously, and at scale. We’ve also entered a period of geopolitical decline. The global balance of power used to be on a trajectory we broadly understood. It’s now changing faster than the institutional architecture we have to govern our fnancial, cultural and power systems can adapt. What’s emerging is a new patchwork of coalitions. This changes global power dynamics and obscures our ability to understand geopolitical developments and tensions. This shift will shape global trade, supply chains and access to resources—and could prove tremendously destabilising. What then can you still trust? The values that underpin our national and global institutions and systems are also challenged by new technologies, global technology giants and new alliances. The digital space has become the latest arena for geopolitics. States are joined by private companies that have accumulated power that makes them arbiters of global affairs, not just bystanders. Trust will be a differentiator. But earning it is hard, and sustaining it will be even harder. 14\n\nT h e 2 0 2 5 S k\n\ni l l s H o r i z o n\n\nO u r\n\nm e s s y\n\nf u t u r e\n\n“ The positive outcomes of our\n\ninvestment into decarbonisation today will be realised closer to 2030, but the process will be neither linear nor elegant, as different sectors will transition on different timelines. There is still a lot of important work to be done in terms of innovation, technology adoption and diversification, and leaders should be planning over short– and long- term horizons.”\n\nCathryn Carver Group Executive, Corporate and Institutional Banking, NAB\n\n5 things to worry about\n\n01\n\nThe values shift\n\n02\n\nThe technology shift\n\n03\n\nThe accountability shift\n\n04\n\nThe trust shift\n\n05\n\nThe energy shift\n\nClick to steal\n\n05\n\nThe energy shift An inelegant transition without a coherent story\n\nThe energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables is slower, more fragmented, more complex than anticipated. The pace of progress has slowed due to economic volatility, increased geopolitical confrontations, technological shifts and the hottest years on record several times over. We’re witnessing an uneven adoption around the globe. And a coherent, common narrative about direction, progress and impact fails to emerge. Limiting negative fallout from the energy transition is now becoming more urgent, as is fnding new ways to accelerate the transition. We could further lose momentum. As the adoption of artifcial intelligence ramps up, the demand for generative searches and generative content could skyrocket, and with it the demand for electricity to power data centres. You’ll continue to manage the tension between having a vision and a roadmap for the future of your company while still being grounded in the reality it fnds itself in today. This shift involves risks and responsibilities for your organisation and its social context. It also creates opportunities to lead if you get the transition right. For you to meet these five shifts and move through this decade with readiness and confidence, you'll need to acquire new skills. 15\n\nT h e 2 0 2 5 S k\n\ni l l s H o r i z o n\n\nO u r\n\nm e s s y\n\nf u t u r e\n\n“ We’re always constantly learning.

        "In a world where change happens continuously, in many parts of your business and life at once? The response is learning and upskilling. You’ll need to reorient yourself and be responsive to the coming changes to understand emerging risks and make use of new opportunities. You’ll need to learn new skills and unlearn old ones. You’ll need to craft initiatives to upskill your leadership teams. The Skills Horizon provides orientation. It tells you what you need to know now, what to learn next and what to look out for. The Skills Horizon is your guide to navigating what lies ahead, through learning and upskilling. It provides you with a strategic lens for prioritising your organisation's leader development. What we take for granted. New skills always build on existing capabilities. They’re most effective when they’re met by deep expertise. The Skills Horizon distills responses to emerging shifts in the environment into key skills to learn and master. It doesn’t, however, tell you everything you need to know as a leader. Horizon skills complement and amplify your expertise and capabilities as a leader. We know that the future of education, and of leadership development, will have to be more responsive and diverse—but it will also build on existing strengths. Degree programs will still provide the kind of formative education that sets up graduates for their careers. Postgraduate degrees offer pathways for professional specialisation and career change. And deep domain expertise and capabilities are gained through experience “on the job”. All this we take for granted. You won’t fnd foundational capabilities on the Skills Horizon. We expect you already know that disruptive times require critical thinking, creative problem-solving and emotional intelligence. You don’t need the Skills Horizon to tell you that. For everything else, we invite you to keep reading …\n\n17\n\nT h e 2 0 2 5 S k\n\ni l l s H o r i z o n\n\nL e a d n g\n\ni\n\nt h e n e x t d e c a d e\n\n“ To be creative it is very important to keep learning about things that are really new.

It summarises in-depth qualitative and quantitative analyses and actionable recommendations that provide insight into the relevancy, maturity and criticality of skills required to thrive in a decade of disorientation. Understanding our methodology will help you get the most out of the Skills Horizon when you use it to evaluate your own skills, your team’s skills, resourcing, skills development and career management. The Skills Horizon cautions against short-lived needs and helps with strategy and strategic planning, capability mapping and strengths assessments. 19\n\nT h e 2 0 2 5 S k\n\ni l l s H o r i z o n\n\n|\n\nA c\n\nl\n\no s e r\n\no o k\n\na t\n\nt h e S k i l l s H o r i z o n\n\nThe Skills Horizon is based on data- and insight- driven analysis backed by a structured methodology that takes into account a range of resources.

You need to have profciencies in this space already or be developing them urgently. Having these skills will provide you with immediate benefts. This is what you need to learn next. You should already be planning on developing these skills or ideally be starting to learn them. Developing these skills will prepare you for near-term opportunities and risks. All current and emerging leaders require an essential core in order to operate in this changing world. These are critical and scarce skills that should be acquired or honed immediately; baseline capabilities we expect for successful ongoing management and leadership. Skills that are in the developmental range have come into focus. We know how to build those capabilities, and forward-thinking current and emerging leaders are already adding them to their core.

This is the main question at the heart of our Skills Horizon research. To answer this question, we draw on a variety of sources and techniques, in three dimensions:\n\nScope We study the context in which skills are needed and we study skills directly. We actively engage with how the world around us is changing, which drives the requirements for new skills. And we study the need for new skills directly by analysing existing skills reports, and through our conversations with senior leaders. Timelines We look back and we look forward. We study existing materials available in the public domain: skills reports and various media that focus on the future of business, society and leadership. And we practice strategic foresight, using signals we observe in the environment and eliciting the views and intuitions of leaders in their felds to understand emerging skills requirements. Sources We incorporate public material and we collect and create our own. We tap into the public conversation around change and skills, as it unfolds in both the media and research. And we engage in private conversations with a diverse group of senior leaders, as well as hold our own private conversations, using foresight techniques to make sense of the future of business. 22\n\nT h e 2 0 2 5 S k\n\ni l l s H o r i z o n\n\nH o w w e b u\n\ni l t\n\ni t\n\nWe bring these three dimensions together in four interrelated studies, from which we have synthesised the Skills Horizon and the detailed skills outlines presented in this report:\n\n1. Thematic media analysis To map how the world is changing, and what the big developments are that shape society and the economy, we built a corpus of data featuring key future-focused publications and conferences. These include Harvard Business Review, The Economist’s World Ahead editions, the World Economic Forum programmes, the SXSW conference and the books that made the “Top Business Books” lists. We then applied topic modelling, thematic analysis and frequency analysis techniques to understand the topics that stood out from these public conversations over time. 4. Senior leader interviews Gaining insight into the private worlds and thoughts of leaders is more challenging, because it involves bringing conversations that happen organically to the surface. At the core of our study are personal interviews and focus group sessions with senior leaders and executives in business, government, academia, defence, culture and the arts. Among others, we spoke with global and Australian CEOs, CHROs, former prime ministers, army generals, government secretaries, NGO and charity leaders, head chefs and arts executives. We asked what they saw impacting their respective organisations over the next decade and what skills they thought leaders would need. i t\n\n4.

It’ll give you an idea of how we identifed and analysed the public conversation. For everything else, keep reading. To map the public conversation, we built a corpus that includes the metadata for a number of future-focused outlets (for the period 2021-2024), such as:\n\nBest Business Books of the Year lists This is what everyone’s reading and/or considers readworthy. Books take a while to write and publish. This gives us a good sense of where the conversation is coming from. Harvard Business Review Everyone’s favourite business research outlet. Research takes some time to do and publish. This adds to our base. The Economist The editors of the World Ahead editions know how to make sense of what’s happening in the economy. This represents the conversation as it happens now. World Economic Forum Annual Meeting World leaders meet in Davos every year to discuss big changes ahead—as they happen and as they make them. This gives us a glimpse of the big picture ahead. SXSW Conference Every March, the who’s who of tech, media and the arts flock to Austin (TX) to reveal the future, as driven by technology. For the analysis, we did as we teach—we employed AI. We used large language models (LLMs) for topic modelling across a sample of these fve outlets. We used TopicGPT, a new, prompt-based, topic modelling framework to identify the topics and sub-topics that characterise the conversation. Frequency analysis gave us percentages."

As a philosophy, it improves inclusion and diversity, builds more adaptable and resilient workforces and makes organisations more responsive to changes by widening their talent pool. Its challenge lies in backgrounding the role of deep expertise and capabilities, in particular for technical professions and leadership roles. Yet, for leadership development, a skills-based approach can be useful when taken as one of many modules in a comprehensive approach to an organisation’s knowledge base. It offers a rigorous focus on skills assessment, learning and upskilling, and adaptability—all of which make it useful in changing environments. “ Disruption now comes in two, three, four-year\n\ncycles, much faster than before.

They’re performance-enhancers that boost the existing capabilities and skills within your organisation. AI fluency This is the ability to understand, engage with and leverage artifcial intelligence technologies practically and effectively for your organisation. You don’t need to be able to code or build AI, but as a leader, you need to know the technology deeply enough to make effective decisions—whether that’s around the alignment of AI initiatives with the strategic objectives of your organisation or the possible impacts of AI on work and people. Fluency includes the use and application of generative AI (Gen AI) but it goes well beyond that. Don’t forget that there are many other forms of AI. In fact, it’s often the boring AI that can beneft your organisation most. Chatbots aren’t everything—data is. And using your own data to train algorithms for tasks specifc to your organisation can be a huge amplifer. For example, the use of Gen AI can make services more accessible for broader stakeholder groups and increase inclusion. AI can also help with effciencies and energy saving by accelerating your energy transition (so long as you keep an eye on its thirst for energy); it’s an important tool in cybersecurity; it sits at the heart of digital transformation projects; and it broadly has the potential to transform your organisation’s services and processes. Once mastered and shared across your team, AI fluency becomes an enabling skill for your organisation. 31\n\nT h e 2 0 2 5 S k\n\ni l l s H o r i z o n\n\nA m p\n\nl i\n\nf e r s\n\n“ Ignoring generative AI as a leader\n\nis like refusing to learn email in the '90s. You can do it, but why make your job harder?”\n\nClaude, by Anthropic\n\n“ We're all trying to understand the ultimate\n\npotential of AI. Each business needs to understand how AI can improve their business, whether it's in efficiency, whether it's new products and services, understanding how customers are using AI, how competitors are using it, but also the boundaries within which they feel comfortable using AI.”\n\nCosima Marriner Managing Editor, The Australian Financial Review\n\nGenerative AI for personal productivity As a forward-thinking leader, you need to know what Gen AI can do for you. You need to understand what its limitations are and how to prompt, and interact, with it effectively. To do that, it takes experimentation, a creative mindset and openness to failure. Once you fgure out how to make Gen AI work for you, it can signifcantly enhance productivity—yours and your team’s. Gen AI can assist with a range of writing and document-related tasks, such as summarising, editing and thematic analysis. It can generate various kinds of content, carry out data analysis and lend a hand with coding tasks. It can help you brainstorm, explore concepts and run meetings. Long story short: it can do a lot. Which makes it a powerful amplifer for many of your other leadership skills, including self- leadership, staying organised, digesting information, quick ideation, even making your messaging more persuasive. Think of Gen AI not as a way to automate tasks, but as a way to amplify your strengths. 90%of workers believe\n\n15%Productivity uplift\n\nthat Gen AI will benefit their work (AWS 2024)\n\nreported by EY consultants \"across the board\" (CIO 2024)\n\n32\n\nT h e 2 0 2 5 S k\n\ni l l s H o r i z o n\n\nA m p\n\nl i\n\nf e r s\n\nTypes of hybrid work FLEXIBLE\n\nFlexible hybrid\n\nOnline- ﬁrst hybrid\n\nO FFIC E- C E N T RIC\n\nSpace- share hybrid\n\nO TE- C E N T RIC R E M\n\nt\n\nTraditional hybrid\n\nCohort hybrid\n\nCO ORDINATED\n\nTraditional hybrid: revolves around the traditional nuclear offce. Some people work (almost) permanently from home (akin to the telework of old); most people work in the offce. Space-share hybrid: the offce is the focal point, but people rotate through the space doing desk- sharing. It’s either a frst come, frst serve basis or more coordinated, with allocated seats. Flexible hybrid: this is the “anything goes, each to their own” model. There are no fxed rules about where and when to work; the offce runs like a campus, with teams coordinating their own rhythms. Cohort hybrid: here, the team is the focal point, rather than the space. Under this enforced hybrid model, teams are always together: some days in the offce, some days remote. Online-first hybrid: everyone works mostly remote. The physical space is used only for socialising or client meetings. Coming together physically can be coordinated or flexible. Click to steal\n\nProductive work communities Post-Covid, work hasn’t been the same. Diverging expectations of where, when and how to work persist. While employees want individual flexibility, many leaders champion the importance of in-person mentoring and ideas exchange. In many ways, work is less about where it happens and more about how it happens (and how people work together). That’s why the ability to create productive work communities has become an urgent skill to master—one that underpins everything else you do in your organisation. You and your leadership team need to learn how to craft a balance between flexibility and complexity. Work flexibility increases individual productivity but it also drives complexity at the system level. When people are dispersed and work at different times, the coordination costs are borne by your leadership team. Rather than managing people’s work, your focus will need to be on facilitating productive communities that can both function in the same room and remotely via digital tools. By building such communities, you increase effectiveness and prevent team issues from manifesting. It’s a true amplifer (or inhibitor, if you get it wrong). “ The landscape of the workplace has changed a lot and we are still learning. People entering the workplace have high expectations of flexibility. Bringing people together in a hybrid workplace is very different today.”\n\nFiona Allan CEO, Opera Australia\n\n33\n\nT h e 2 0 2 5 S k\n\ni l l s H o r i z o n\n\nA m p\n\nl i\n\nf e r s\n\n“AI is geopolitical.

Their prominence has come in response to global trends. Geopolitics in business The global balance of power is shifting and the way governments yield economic tools is increasing. The question of what comes next remains an open one. If you’re a leader in any organisation that’s exposed to international trade, cross- border sourcing or global supply chains, you’ll need to be far more informed about geopolitical developments. You’ll need to become skilled at reading and interpreting the policy moves by nation states through a business lens. And you’ll need to understand the long-term implications of short-term global events and crises. Recent conflicts in the Middle East and Eastern Europe have disrupted international supply lines. Growing nationalist and protectionist tendencies in countries across the globe are changing the trade landscape. And this year will see more elections than any time in human history, which will alter diplomatic dynamics. Geopolitics has dominated the headlines this year and will continue to hold the spotlight for some time."

Your organisation, now or in the near future, will face legal requirements to report on its energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. With energy costs from carbon-rich sources set to rise in the short- to medium- term, it makes good economic sense for you to think about your organisation’s transition to a net zero energy mix. Financial institutions and markets will be increasingly sensitive to your exposure to carbon and climate risks. And with ongoing concerns about climate change, the public will be keeping an eye on your carbon footprint. To smoothly guide your organisation’s transition, you and your leadership team will need a sound, strategic understanding of the reporting requirements, risk implications and frameworks for setting and managing decarbonisation goals. From reporting requirements to risk management, legislative changes to social responsibility, understanding net zero transition is a key still for leaders to learn. As such, it’s a Big Mover on the 2025 Skills Horizon. 36\n\nT h e 2 0 2 5 S k\n\ni l l s H o r i z o n\n\nB i g M o v e r s\n\nUnexpected Emergers Keep an eye out\n\nPRODUCTIVE BASE\n\nDEVELOPMENTAL\n\nG N G R E M E\n\nI\n\nThese skills are the new wild cards, brought about by changing circumstances. If applied effectively, they’ll allow you to capitalise on big (and possibly surprising) opportunities. Leading across generations In our research, we were surprised by how many leaders told us about the growing challenges and diffculties with managing intergenerational difference. This comprises differences in work practices and styles, as well as differing expectations about what work and careers are for. As people live longer and work longer, more generations will come together in your workplace, which increases diversity. Diversity is a good thing. When harnessed productively, it provides different perspectives and inputs. But how will you communicate effectively when the gulf of intergenerational expectations is widening? And how will you balance difference with the need for inclusion and belonging? Your ongoing challenge as a leader is to create environments in which you can cultivate diverse perspectives across generations, without conflicting expectations causing chaos across age groups. As such, the ability to lead across generations is an explicit skill you’ll soon need to hone. 37\n\nT h e 2 0 2 5 S k\n\ni l l s H o r i z o n\n\nU n e x p e c t e d E m e r g e r s\n\nHumanities thinking We live in the most technological age, with more data than ever and powerful AI to help us make decisions. And yet, unexpectedly, in our research we heard repeatedly from leaders that we must embrace the humanities. The coming decade of disorientation brings with it many uncertainties. Uncertainty means incomplete information and unclear paths forward. When established values and practices are fractured, old ways no longer work and new ones need to be found. In the absence of clear information, reflective thinking is needed. In the absence of clear answers, good questions are needed. To complement your analytical acumen, consider what the humanities have to offer. Interpretation, sense- making and imagination. Crafting narratives with analogies, metaphors and counterintuitive examples. The ability to learn from history, change your mind confdently and fnd solutions in unexpected spaces. All these techniques are part of humanities thinking. The future will be messy. This is where humanities thinking shines.

So we were surprised to see strongly growing interest in our conversations with leaders, and in other data sources like conferences and media publications. There’s a need to get your head around quantum early. Soon enough, you’ll fnd yourself in conversations where it comes up, exploring questions like: What will quantum mean for AI? Will it break encryption? Which industries will beneft most? Which ones will be disrupted? What should we know today, and when should we prepare for quantum’s arrival? It’ll be equally important for you to know what quantum is and isn’t. If you’re in an industry that’ll be affected, quantum will need to be on your strategy roadmap.

We’re in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In the Third, we computerised many operations and, with the emergence of the Internet, moved business online. But now, with the primacy of data, the emerging “digital frst” paradigm, and AI and robotics ready for prime time, we’ve created new building blocks for deep transformation of business models, industries and societal processes. All this is well underway and without clear direction. QUANTUM LITERACY\n\nDIGITAL ETHICS\n\nGEN AI FOR PRODUCTIVITY\n\nA multitude of shifts catalysed by technology—in values, institutions and geopolitical orders—are happening at the same time. While the destination is hard to predict, this transformation poses existential questions for many businesses. As processes become datafed and digitised—the digital transformation market is expected to grow 81% between 2023-2027 (Statista, 2024)— and as algorithms augment more and more aspects of our organisations and lives, you’ll require a deeper understanding of the functioning and effects of technology. Tech is more undefined than ever Digital technology can no longer be understood as just tools for certain problems or tasks. Rather, digital technology such as AI is best seen as general-purpose infrastructure for rethinking work, processes and business models. Digital technology is open-ended. It affords more opportunities for innovation than ever, but it requires your interpretation in context. At the heart of the “digital frst” paradigm is the need to strategically rethink how things work and how they could work better. Given its open-ended nature, technology demands your involvement. Tech is different these days The newest generation of computing technology is different to what you’ve grown used to. AI brings powerful new predictive and generative capabilities. But it lacks the accuracy, accountability and transparency of traditional computing. The role of data has changed, too. And when it comes to AI, data is everything. AI needs a lot of it, and it needs to be good quality. According to Statista (2024), data management is the leading AI infrastructure challenge. On the other hand, AI now simulates, quite convincingly, many human traits: communication, problem-solving, content creation. In a recent study, 79% of respondents found AI-generated responses more empathetic than those written by doctors (JAMA, 2023). Yet AI still functions quite differently to us. Those nuances and differences will matter to your business, so you need to know about them. 45\n\nT h e 2 0 2 5 S k\n\ni l l s H o r i z o n\n\nB o b 1 :\n\nl\n\nS p e a k i\n\nn g\n\nt h e\n\nl\n\na n g u a g e o f\n\nt e c h\n\nTech is everywhere Digital technology permeates our workplaces and society, and AI is rapidly changing the way we work. According to AWS (2024), as much as 84% of employers expect productive use of Gen AI in their workplaces in the next fve years. Even if you don't pay attention to Gen AI, you'll still encounter its output at the offce. In a 2023 Salesforce survey, 55% of workers said they'd used unapproved Gen AI apps, while 64% had passed off the output of generative AI as their own work. Many leaders fnd themselves playing catch-up with their employees on using Gen AI for personal productivity. Consider getting in front of this trend by upskilling yourself. Tech brings new challenges and risks Since tech is everywhere and touches everything, it also brings new risks and vulnerabilities. AI, in particular, goes to the heart of our humanity. The datafcation of life brings with it questions about data sovereignty and privacy. The digitisation of core processes creates vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. The use of algorithms in decisions about work and people raises questions of fairness and ethics. Data and algorithm regulations are fast-evolving both nationally and globally. This creates complex and sometimes conflicting requirements for executives and directors. Cybersecurity, privacy and digital ethics are no longer specialist topics—they call for your attention and informed leadership. Tech is for generalists now In 2025, decisions about tech and digital-frst approaches are strategic, not operational. Executing on tech might be for specialists, but deciding on tech is for generalists. That means you and your leadership team. It might be time to audit your leadership teams’ digital, data and AI fluencies. How well is your organisation speaking the language of tech? “It will increasingly be important\n\nto create an AI-ready organisation. Rather than, ‘Can AI solve this problem?’, how can you set up the organisation so it can make use of AI, formulate business problems so that AI can help –what data you collect, how you create value, in a way so that machine learning can solve that for you.”\n\nMichael Spranger President, Sony AI\n\nCOO, Sony Research\n\nThe skills in this Blob AI fluency: the ability to understand the nature, capabilities, and challenges of (generative) AI; converse confdently with AI stakeholders; and guide the strategic development of AI use cases and decisions for their operational implementation.

Aside from air-con, do you know your exposure to geopolitical risk? Decades of stability in the global geopolitical order have ended. You’re facing a new era of instabilities with unclear trajectories. Various factors like the economic power shift towards China (and Asia more broadly), changes in US trade policy, and various military conflicts have led to geopolitical disruptions that have yet to fnd a new, trusted equilibrium. According to KPMG’s 2024 Top Risks Forecast, global CEOs named global trade policy restrictions and vulnerabilities from global conflict as their most pressing future risk. MEGAPROJECT LITERACY\n\nPROVENANCE AND TRACEABILITY\n\nBUILDING TRUST AT SCALE\n\nNET ZERO TRANSITION\n\nHeightened global tendencies towards nationalism and protectionism have led to bureaucratic frictions and new tariffs that have raised the costs of international trade. Nation-states use business subsidies and trade sanctions as measures of geostrategic competition. Growing populism in many democracies comes with implications for immigration and global talent mobility. And military conflicts are putting strains on supply chains, again leading to higher costs. According to Howden's 2024 Geopolitical Risk Report, the Russia-Ukraine conflict caused a three-fold increase in freight rates for certain routes and signifcantly higher insurance costs. If your organisation is exposed to international markets or depends on global supply chains for access to customers, suppliers, parts, resources or talent (and really, whose doesn’t?), you’ll need to understand the strategic impacts of geopolitical developments. Climate risks and energy transition need your attention Climate change presents long-term risks for most businesses: fnancially, in terms of access to investment capital; and physically, in terms of exposure to extreme weather events. BCG (2023) predicts that leading global corporations face a potential reduction in annual EBITDA of as much as 15% from extreme weather impacts. Aon points to signifcant under-insurance in global assets, quantifying the global protection gap against extreme weather at 69%, with a total of US$262 billion in uninsured losses globally in 2023. At the same time, the global energy transition comes with signifcant opportunities. While transitioning your organisation to renewable energy and net zero brings early cost advantages, any business with a considerable exposure to energy costs will need to pay attention as fossil fuels are phased out, taxed or become more expensive. Finally, investment in clean energy creates new business and markets. According to Goldman Sachs Asset Management (2023), the US Inflation Reduction Act alone resulted in US$282 billion in investment in 2022, funding 280 clean energy projects across 44 US States. Whether driven opportunistically or by cost and risk considerations, you’ll beneft from foundational skills to lead your organisation’s net zero transition in the context of the wider energy transition. 51\n\nT h e 2 0 2 5 S k\n\ni l l s H o r i z o n\n\nB o b 2 :\n\nl\n\nS o\n\nl v i\n\nn g p r o b\n\nl\n\ne m s o f\n\ns c a\n\nl\n\ne\n\nAccountability and dependencies at the systems level Increasingly, you need to be aware of accountability requirements and dependencies at the scale of global systems. Provenance refers to the tracing of and accounting for the cumulative origin of products and services at the system level. It extends to a diverse range of issues, including: human, labour, Indigenous and local community rights; biodiversity and climate impact; product quality and safety; and various compliance matters. For example, the new European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) stipulates that commodities like soya, wood and cattle for export to the EU have to meet new rules relating to the land on which they were produced. Exporters need to reliably demonstrate that no parts of their products are associated with possible deforestation, which raises novel requirements for accountability through provenance tracking. Similarly, carbon accounting will need to move to the systems level, as organisations start accounting for Scope 3, their indirect carbon emissions that affect their products and services. According to the World Economic Forum, in complex global value chains like food and fashion, Scope 3 upstream emissions can represent up to 70% of a company’s carbon balance. If accountability and dependencies at the systems level are becoming mission critical to meet regulatory requirements and retain market access, you’ll need to become familiar not only with new requirements but also new provenance and traceability approaches. Thinking bigger Solving problems of scale takes a number of convergent skills: geopolitics, net zero transition, energy transition, accounting at the systems level through provenance. These skills interact in complex ways, all driven by increasingly complex global regulation. You’ll also need to be able to build trust at scale. In addition to the aforementioned skills, solving problems of scale requires complex, multi-party ecosystems and an understanding of the unique characteristics of large-scale projects. This means working with local and global communities and governments at all levels to maintain legitimacy and retain your social licence to operate. “We live at the end of the unipolar era of US world leadership, with a resurgence of state-on-state competition, with ample potential for business disruptions to supply chains.”\n\nMajor General (Retired) Gus McLachlan AO\n\nThe skills in this Blob Geopolitics in business: the ability to understand and interpret geopolitical developments through a business lens; make sense of policy moves by nation states; and assess the long-term implications of short-term geopolitical events and global crises.

        "But how do we foster diversity without getting lost in difference? Leading across generations\n\nThe very premise of an organisation is to bring people together through shared goals, values and routines. Yet as we welcome more diverse perspectives, we must also grapple with the complexities that arise when differing expectations meet—around work styles, flexibility, performance, communication, and the organisation’s role in society and public discourse. Inclusive leadership\n\nManaging with purpose\n\nProductive work communities\n\nYou’re at the forefront of navigating these differences and complexities. So, you must ask yourself: How can we use difference productively while fnding and amplifying commonalities? How can we value each individual, and their differences, while building inclusive, cohesive and productive communities? How can we craft a sense of belonging and balance the needs of individuals with those of the collective? Click to steal\n\n55\n\n“We have removed friction from systems and this has changed how people participate in public and corporate conversations. It has created huge problems in terms of what people say and how quickly they say it.”\n\nRobert Thomson Chief Executive, News Corp\n\n\"Many Indigenous leaders often share with me, the most successful relationships they have (beyond the relationship with their own communities) is with corporate Australia. And it's because there's high capability on the corporate side, there's less churn of staff. So, you tend to have longer term relationships, and corporates have a strong focus on practical reconciliation, and doing things that create value and increase productivity.\"\n\nShane Webster CEO, Jawun\n\n“There is great variation\n\nbetween countries and regions when it comes to hybrid work. Leaders will have to figure out what this will do to company culture, the sense of belonging to a company, to learning and upskilling, the ability to learn from others, and even productivity over time.”\n\nMorten Wierod CEO, ABB\n\n\"The cultural winds are blowing almost towards ageism. We seem to increasingly put more weight on younger generations’ views. And the elder statesmen are denounced or derided, just simply because they're old.\"\n\nNathan Birch CEO, Interbrand ANZ\n\n“When we have so\n\nmany things that are automated, where technology does it for us, human interaction skills become more and more important. Knowing how to persuade people, how to inspire them, knowing how to resolve conflict, how to make sure everyone's getting what they need out of an interaction, knowing how to put boundaries -that is important as a leader.”\n\nCosima Marriner Managing Editor,\n\nThe Australian Financial Review\n\n56\n\nBLOB 3: Working across difference\n\nPERSUASIVE STORY CRAFTING\n\nINCLUSIVE LEADERSHIP\n\nPRODUCTIVE WORK COMMUNITIES\n\nLEADING ACROSS GENERATIONS\n\nMANAGING WITH PURPOSE\n\nDiverse differences Diversity itself is diverse. From age and gender to ethnicity and neurodiversity, the dimensions of difference in today's workplaces are as varied as they are numerous. Each form of diversity brings its own unique opportunities and challenges. For example, while older employees bring valuable knowledge and experience, they may face ageism. Younger employees bring fresh thinking, but they often have very different expectations about the meaning and purpose of work- not to mention diversity itself. According to the World Economic Forum (2023), 68% of Gen Z employees are dissatisfed with their organisation's progress on diversity and inclusion. Global differences in culture and expectations add another layer of complexity, highlighting the tension between the need to standardise large-scale initiatives and cater for local diversity. To understand your workforce and customer base better, it’s crucial to reflect diversity in your leadership teams and boards. Ask yourself: Is their diversity reflected? Can your younger employees see themselves in a leadership role in your business? Crafting communities Merely collecting diversity isn’t enough; it must be harnessed productively and woven together to create inclusion and belonging. A 2017 Salesforce study found that employees who feel a sense of belonging are 5.3 times more empowered than those who don't. While focusing on differences can highlight divisions, it’s essential to recognise the many commonalities that unite us. It’s your role to hone the differences while managing the collective, with organisational culture playing a key role in this process. You need to learn to facilitate and foster productive work communities. Balancing purpose and positions More and more, you’re being asked to balance the expectations of a growing number of stakeholders regarding your organisation's purpose. In the global Edelman Trust Barometer, 75% of respondents said that a company's primary duty is to engage in societal duties, including tackling climate change and discrimination (Edelman 2024). But how do you put that into practice? Public and private spheres continue to overlap, so activism and politics continue to enter our workplaces. Your employees might demand that you and your organisation take a position on controversial public issues. But doing so will always alienate one or another stakeholder group. All this is compounded by frictionless communication in digital media, which amplify differences, making discourse heated and fast-paced. When addressing social issues, success lies not in avoidance or seeking unanimous support, but in fnding a set of principles aligned with your organisation's values to guide your approach in engaging with public debate. 57\n\nT h e 2 0 2 5 S k\n\ni l l s H o r i z o n\n\nB o b 3 :\n\nl\n\nW o r k i\n\nn g\n\na c r o s s d i f f e r e n c e\n\nHybrid is not one thing Hybrid work is here to stay. The post-Covid reality has revealed that flexibility means different things to different people, leading to a complex landscape of individual expectations and preferences. Some employees thrive on the autonomy of remote work; others crave the structure and social interaction of the offce. It’s on you to navigate these diverse needs while ensuring that the organisation’s objectives are met. Hybrid work increases complexity and coordination costs for leaders. You must fnd ways to accommodate different work styles and communication preferences while synchronising joint activities and maintaining fairness and inclusivity in the team. This may involve experimenting with new approaches, flexible schedules and output-based, instead of activity-based, performance metrics. Collective resilience Remote work can lead to loneliness. A recent Gallup survey found that 25% of remote workers had experienced feelings of loneliness in the 24-hour period prior to being surveyed. Isolation isn't the only challenge to contend with. The complexity of managing diverse workforces can lead to stress, fatigue and mental wellbeing challenges for leaders. Although mental health is now an important leadership priority, only 34% of employees report that their leaders speak openly about mental health (MHA 2022). Promoting organisational wellbeing has become a leadership imperative. Bridging differences, fostering belonging Working across difference is a delicate balancing act. You must develop the skills to use difference productively while fostering a sense of belonging and shared purpose. This requires navigating the complexities of diverse expectations, fnding common ground, and creating inclusive communities where individuals feel valued and empowered to contribute their viewpoints. No one experiences these differences and complexities more than you. Your ability to bridge differences, resolve conflicts and persuade people to work together towards a single goal will be crucial in creating resilient, cohesive, diverse teams that thrive. “Executives will need to exercise their minds on how they can cultivate a good life, and an exciting and fulfilling life, for those who work for them.”\n\nDavid Gonski AC Chancellor, UNSW\n\nThe skills in this Blob Managing with purpose: the ability to inspire employees by clearly articulating and embodying organisational purpose, values and goals.

Shifts in the nature of technology, societal values, trust in institutions, and the geopolitical landscape will create a web of interconnected arenas that compete for your attention. These shifts are joined by unforeseen shocks, crises and conflicts that further increase complexity, as their impacts ripple through global systems in unpredictable ways. At the same time, the speed at which new issues emerge and require your response has accelerated due to digital communication. As a result, you’ll often fnd yourself needing to make decisions without full information, as stakeholder expectations for swift action add pressure to an already challenging situation. Complexity, characterised by the many moving, interconnected parts that interact with each other in unpredictable ways, makes it diffcult to predict outcomes. To manage in this environment, it’ll pay to adopt probabilistic over deterministic thinking, and to embrace the inherent uncertainties in complex situations, rather than trying to control a situation that’s hard to grasp in the frst place. Messy uncertainties Complexity is joined by uncertainty. According to KPMG’s Keeping us up at night report and Ai Group’s Australian CEO Expectations survey (2024), there’s a strong increase in feelings of uncertainty among leaders. In times to come you’ll face more and more messy, unclear and ambiguous issues-often lacking the information or understanding needed to navigate them to your satisfaction. BLOB 4: Thinking through complexity\n\nPROBABILISTIC THINKING\n\nSELF- LEADERSHIP\n\nHUMANITIES THINKING\n\nYour challenge is intensifed by the prevalence of disinformation, highly ideological debates and polarisation in society. As such, leadership becomes less about making factual decisions and more about navigating dilemmas, conflicting values and matters of right and wrong. UNLEARNING\n\nMANAGING THROUGH COMPLEXITY\n\nFUTURES THINKING\n\nTo address this, you’ll want to draw on techniques from the humanities, such as interpretation, sense-making and imagination. You'll also beneft from alternative approaches to thinking, including First Nations wisdom and other diverse perspectives. 63\n\nT h e 2 0 2 5 S k\n\ni l l s H o r i z o n\n\nB o b 4 :\n\nl\n\nT h\n\ni\n\nn k i\n\nn g\n\nt h r o u g h c o m p\n\nl\n\ne x i t y\n\nConnectivity and information overwhelm For most leaders, time is their scarcest resource-and it gets used up fast. Constant connectivity, coupled with the sheer volume of available information enabled by digital technology, is overwhelming. Too many workplace apps, and the need for frequent switching between them, compete for your limited time and attention span. In a study by Microsoft (2023), 68% of respondents said they don't have enough uninterrupted focus time. The abundance of data and information before you can lead to overload. And data quality concerns mean you often need to fll in the blanks. To combat this, you need to invest in self-leadership, prioritise effectively, develop a balanced media diet and employ techniques to stay informed without losing track of what needs attention. “You have to keep looking for\n\nyour critics and bring them in to disagree with you, rather than avoid them. It’s dramatically easier for them to see the flaws in your ideas than for you to, so that’s the best way to make true progress on your ideas.”\n\nSaul Perlmutter Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist\n\nWhen things change, you’ll be wrong In a values-laden environment, you must fnd ways to productively work with disagreement and embrace criticism to learn and improve. Engaging with diverse perspectives and dissenting opinions can help you see blind spots and challenge your assumptions. When presented with compelling evidence or arguments, balance decisiveness with the ability to change your mind. In a complex and uncertain world, being able to adapt your thinking and strategies in light of new information will become a leadership advantage. As circumstances evolve, the ability to unlearn outdated approaches and embrace new ideas will become a competitive advantage. Leaders who can admit mistakes, learn from failure and course-correct when necessary not only show commitment to evidence-based management but also have the edge this decade. Questions lead to clarity In the absence of clear information, you need thinking. In the absence of clear answers, you need to fnd good questions. Only by identifying the right questions can you lead your organisation through uncertainty and complexity. Developing your skills in probabilistic thinking, humanities thinking, futures thinking, self-leadership and the ability to unlearn will be essential in thinking through our messy future. The skills in this Blob Self-leadership: the ability to manage your attention in the face of hyper-connectivity and information overload; develop a balanced media diet; prioritise tasks; maintain focus; and cultivate mindfulness to navigate the complexities of the modern workplace.

Most notably, he was awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics. It's hard to think of any psychologist whose work has influenced so many different felds. But I will remember him most for teaching me that the big accomplishments of one’s life are also in how we do things: the joy of fnding out you’re wrong and then changing your mind. It’s great life advice but also great leadership advice. In life and in business (schools), there’s very little emphasis on changing one’s mind. There’s almost a stigma attached to it, which leaves us unprepared when the world changes or when we make research advances and better understand things. We face a decade of disorientation. A messy future. And there will be times when you’ll be wrong. I hope you’ll fnd joy and excitement in changing your mind— it'll help you learn, grow and make discoveries. So... What will you change your mind about? - Sandra\n\n70\n\nAbout Sydney Executive Plus, a strategic initiative of The University of Sydney Business School\n\nWe’re part of Australia’s most iconic, global top 20 university.

In order to meet the needs of the job competence, vocational students should have good work skills. The purpose of this study was to determine the need for skills of work consisting of soft skills and hard skills for vocational education students of mechanical engineering. This research was quantitative descriptive analysis conducted by using Dacum approach. The sample of the study consisted of 100 respondents, comprising industry practitioners, vocational education practitioners, and relevant expert of vocational education in engineering. Based on the analysis, there are 27 items of soft skills and 67 items of hard skills recommended for works for vocational students.

The absorption of employment\n\nnationally for Vocational Senior High Schools (SMK) are 10.87%, lower than high School\n\ngraduates who are at 20.52%, for Junior high school is to 18.16% even for elementary\n\nschool levels is far greater for 42.23%, which means there are a lot of unemployment and\n\nhigh employment absorption differences between graduates of the education levels. For example, one of the provinces in Indonesia, Riau Islands, has been carrying out\n\ndevelopment with a complete infrastructure in several areas: agriculture, marine and\n\nindustrial. Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics [4], in accordance with the engine\n\nworks, the number of workers absorbed in the ﬁeld of industry of manufacturing and\n\nmachining in Riau Islands was 41.20%. The majority of the industry is located in Batam,\n\nbut the uptake of its workforce is still very low. An important issue must be resolved. It should be with great potential that can be used to resolve such issues, especially\n\nvocational schools in order to meet the needs of the industry, the world of work and\n\nincreasing the number of employment absorption of the vocational education. Learning at SMK has not approached aspects of hard skills and soft skills comprehen-\n\nsively and thoroughly so that graduates are not quite enough to have hard skills and soft\n\nskills, that industry needs. Developing hard skills and soft skills directly integrated with\n\nthe work process form the experience of hard skills and soft skills in the learning process\n\ndirectly. [9;12;15]. SMK can improve the competency skills through appropriate learning\n\nstrategies to ﬁt the needs of work, improving knowledge, attitudes, skills, and values\n\nthat are needed for the job. Students should be provided with the knowledge, skills,\n\nattitudes, and values necessary in a real working environment.[16; 9] integrated learn-\n\ning with the world of work, provide experience to students and build bridges between\n\nschool education with the professional working world. Learning that is integrated with\n\nreal working world provides a huge beneﬁt in the acquisition of vocational competence. [3; 22], Integration with the world of work is a form of environmental role to change the\n\ncompetence of vocational students achieving sustainable development. The learning system should be established in accordance with the needs of the com-\n\nmunity, this analysis is an important step to map the special needs of work skills in the\n\nmechanical engineering department of SMK to be used as a reference in composing the\n\nlearning. The aim of this research is to determine the extent of needs of soft skills and\n\nhard skills for SMK students as an effort to develop work competence skills of students\n\nmajoring mechanical engineering. Page 2\n\nDOI 10.18502/kss.v3i15.4349\n\nICEST 2018\n\n2. Literature Review\n\nThe dynamic changes in the industry need to be observed so that learning process that\n\nis similar to the industry standard is necessary. Learning is a process toward change. Learning is the process of Obtaining mastery, knowledge, habits, which is Obtained\n\nfrom the process of learning,[23]. The knowledge that is Obtained in the form of facts,\n\nconcepts, procedures, and principles of students characteristic can do so by involving\n\ninteraction with the external environment that can change someone’s behavior,[23; 18;\n\n21]. Vocational education must have the principle of change in accordance with the\n\nneeds of society and technology. [16], the second proposition, “Eﬀective Vocational\n\ntraining can only be given where the training jobs are carried on in the same way with\n\nthesameoperations,thesametoolsandthesamemachinesasintheoccupationitself”. Vocational education can produce competent workforce should meet these standards. Vocational education as one vehicle to prepare students for the world of work must be\n\nfuture-oriented. (Adrian, 2005), socialize people into attitudes appropriate for the world\n\nof work, orientate people to understand the world of employment and to prepare for the\n\nchoices and transition they will have to make on entering it, prepare them with speciﬁc\n\nskills and knowledge to apply in a direct way after entering employment. Appropriate learning is integrating it with the industry. The main principle in the indus-\n\ntry is to achieve efﬁciency and high productivity. It was implemented by way of applying\n\nLean Manufacturing. Lean is a production system that claims to create learning orga-\n\nnizations through continuous improvements, [10;2]. [25], The Five Primary Elements for\n\nlean manufacturing are (1) Manufacturing Flow, (2) Organization, (3) Process Control, (4)\n\nMetrics, and (5) Logistics. Lean manufacturing is a concept and principles used in the\n\ncompany and the production process to maximize the work to achieve the maximum\n\nbeneﬁt by applying the ﬁve principles with no separation. [25],”Lean manufacturing, is\n\nprimarily focused on designing a robust production operation that is responsive, ﬂexi-\n\nble, predictable, and consistent. [11],”it is called Lean because, in the end, the process, it\n\ncan run: Using less material, requiring less investment, Using less inventory, Consuming\n\nless space and, using fewer people”. Achieving high efﬁciency and productivity at work,\n\nvocational school graduates must have the skills of work in accordance with the needs\n\nof the workforce. Work Skills, a skill that needs to be owned by individuals in the process\n\nof work, consists of hard skills and soft skills. Hard skills in vocational education are one\n\namong the skills that must be possessed by vocational students to achieve competence. [9], “There are some skills that are speciﬁc to needs in industry and manufacturing, the\n\nskills need will be very important as a defense to face of the information development\n\nPage 3\n\nDOI 10.18502/kss.v3i15.4349\n\nICEST 2018\n\nand the environment rapidly”. Hard skills are abilities related to something that can be\n\nlearned in education aimed at improving intellectual ability. [7],” hard skills are technical\n\nor administrative procedures related to an organization’s core of the business”, [13],\n\n“Hard skills are skills where the rules stay the same regardless of which company, cir-\n\ncumstance or people you work with.”, While Soft skills are the abilities of each individual,\n\ncannot be seen, but the soft skills are the ability to which play a huge role in one’s life,\n\nwhich strongly support someone’s ability, career and job, [9; 7]. Appropriate soft skills\n\nplay an important role in a successful career as well as during social interactions in\n\nthe society. In addition, Reviews on these skills are highly sought after by employers\n\nrecruiting fresh graduates ”. [9; 26]. ”Soft Skills are character traits, attitudes, and behaviors-rather than knowledge\n\nor technical aptitude. Soft skills are the intangible, nontechnical, personality-speciﬁc\n\nskills that determine one’s strengths as a leader, facilitator, mediator, and negotiator”. [7],”They have to do with how people relate to each other: communicating, listening,\n\nengaging in dialogue, giving feedback, cooperating as a team member, solving prob-\n\nlems, contributing in conducted some ﬁrst-rate training and was well meetings and\n\nresolving conﬂict”. [6], in line state, that “the impact which the soft skills training could\n\ngive in enhancing the output of hard skills”. “Soft skills play a crucial role in making\n\nstudents employable as it enables them to be ﬂexible, positive to change, handle ever-\n\nincreasing expectations of employers and to stay globally competitive”. [17], proposes\n\nthe structure of the future work in the industrial world will eliminate more jobs of non-\n\nskills, which will be replaced with jobs that require skills, a high expertise in the areas of\n\nreading, computation, communication, and problem-solving or reasoning skills. Work Skills needed by industry is done Dacum needs analysis approach. This\n\napproach is used in a variety of methods to determine the accuracy of the use of learning\n\nand competency mapping by practitioners or specialists who have done the work and\n\nactivities in accordance with the areas of expertise [9; 14]. The results of the analysis will\n\nshow the gap between teachings and learn in a vocational school with work processes\n\nand activities in the industry. The gap found will be a basis for the development to\n\nimprove the learning process through Lean-based learning model. 3. Research Method\n\nType of this research was descriptive quantitative, through DACUM (Developing a Cur-\n\nriculum) approach.[14; 9]. The sample of this study was 100 respondents by using random\n\nsampling. It consisted of teachers of Mechanical Engineering Department, Practitioner\n\nPage 4\n\nDOI 10.18502/kss.v3i15.4349\n\nICEST 2018\n\nof Machining Industry, and Expert/Lecturer of mechanical for the vocational high school\n\nof Mechanical Engineering. The research instrument used was a questionnaire that is\n\nbased on the prepared blueprint in accordance with the needs of work skills of the voca-\n\ntional high school of Mechanical Engineering. The questionnaire used a Likert scale. Validity and reliability of research instrument used expert judgment that consisted of\n\nseven experts\n\n4. Result and Discussion\n\nThe results of needs analysis of work skills are categorized into two parts: soft skills and\n\nhard skills for SMK students who are majoring mechanical engineering. For engineering\n\nneeds of work skills in Mechanical Engineering of Vocational High school, it was used\n\nquestionnaires which were ﬁlled out by respondents by using four categories of the\n\nscale options of Likert; very Important,\n\nImportant, Less Important and Not Urgent. Response to work skills needed by using the questionnaire was determined through\n\nrespondents’ level of achievement. Decision criteria of the level of achievement of\n\nresponse were assigning a minimum of 50% of the total number of respondents’\n\npreferences through a questionnaire to the category selection agree and strongly\n\nagree. Based on the level of achievement of the indicator, there was elected as new\n\nrecommendations for the establishment of indicators on soft skills and hard skills\n\nof students of vocational education in mechanical engineering. The results of the\n\nanalysis are used in an attempt to build a new learning model of Lean-based learning\n\nmodel design for vocational high school students in an effort to improve work skills\n\nand competencies. The following is described further about respondents’\n\nlevel of\n\nachievement indicators and tables on recommended soft skills and hard skills. 4.1. Soft skills\n\nNeeds analysis of soft skills was categorized into two parts, namely general soft skills\n\nand speciﬁc soft skills in the ﬁeld of machining jobs [9].General Soft skills category of\n\nmachining jobs: 1).Demonstrating a willingness to develop a career, 68%, and 32%, 2).

The intricate network of specialties within the fascinating ﬁeld has been thor- oughly explored across multiple chapters. Mechatronics is the synthesis of several sciences, such as electronic and mechanical engineering, computer science, and control systems, with the goal of building intelligent, adaptive systems that can trans- form industries and improve our daily lives. It’s clear from our analysis of potential developments in mechatronics engineering that this ﬁeld is headed for explosive growth and innovation. The most notable trend inﬂuencing mechatronics in the future is the speed at which artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are developing. Mechatronic systems are progressively being equipped with AI algorithms, which allow them to perceive and react to complicated situations with previously unheard-of accuracy and efﬁciency. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) is enabling robots with cognitive capacities that were previously limited to humans, opening up new possibilities in mechatronics. Examples of this include driverless cars navigating congested city streets and robotic assistants performing delicate surgical procedures. Moreover, the convergence of edge computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) with mechatronics is opening up exciting new possibilities for networked, intelli- gent systems. Mechatronic systems can gather enormous volumes of data in real time with the use of IoT sensors and actuators, facilitating improved user experi- ences, predictive maintenance, and energy consumption optimization. By processing data at the source and decreasing latency and reliance on centralized infrastruc- ture, edge computing’s spread further improves the scalability and responsiveness of mechatronic systems.

Simultaneously, the discipline of robotics keeps expanding the frontiers of mecha- tronics. Technological developments in material science, sensing, and bioinspired design are opening up new possibilities for the creation of robots that can function in a variety of settings, from the surface of far-off planets to the ocean’s depths. Collaborative robots, also known as Cobots, are collaborating with human oper- ators to increase efﬁciency and safety in industrial settings, thereby transforming manufacturing. Robots are being used more and more in industries like healthcare, agriculture, and disaster relief because they can supplement human abilities and reduce risks. This is because robots are becoming more agile and versatile. Another important development in mechatronics engineering is the focus on envi- ronmental stewardship and sustainability. There is an increasing need for mechatronic solutions that are recyclable, low-impact on the environment, and energy-efﬁcient as the globe struggles with resource depletion and climate change. Engineers are making mechatronic systems both technologically innovative and environmentally responsible by integrating eco-design and circular economy ideas from the design phase to end-of-life disposal. Furthermore, the democratization of mechatronics is promoting an innovative and entrepreneurial culture, with DIY enthusiasts and companies spearheading community-driven innovation, open-source hardware, and grassroots prototype projects. With the help of platforms like Arduino and Raspberry Pi, mechatronic experimentation has become more accessible, enabling people with a variety of backgrounds to work together on projects ranging from wearable technology to home automation. Nevertheless, it’s important to recognize the moral and societal ramiﬁcations of mechatronics engineering in the middle of these fascinating advances. Concerns about employment displacement, security, and privacy are major issues as intelligent robots grow more and more ingrained in our daily lives. To guarantee that mechatronic systems are developed and implemented in a way that puts human well-being, equity, and social responsibility ﬁrst, engineers and legislators must collaborate. To sum up, mechatronics engineering has a promising future ahead of it. The ﬁeld of mechatronics is changing at an astounding rate, from AI-driven robots to networked IoT ecosystems, from sustainable design principles to grassroots creativity. By keeping up with new developments, encouraging cross-disciplinary cooperation, and adhering to moral principles, we may harness the transformative potential of mechatronics to build a more prosperous, just, and sustainable future for future generations. Remember that the real test of success is not just how far technology has come, but also how much of a positive inﬂuence we have on the world and the lives of those around us, as we set out on this path of discovery and invention. Conclusion and Future Trends of Mechatronics\n\n2 Future Trends in Mechatronics Engineering\n\nUnderstanding and strengthening engineering methodologies is becoming more and more dependent on the current trend toward more complicated and diverse system development. The efﬁcient and fruitful administration of these systems will follow from this. Both academics and businesses face new problems as a result of scientiﬁc breakthroughs in areas such as computer engineering, simu- lation and modeling, power electronics, microprocessors, electromechanical motion tools, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), and distributed system platforms (DSPs). Advanced mechatronic product design relies heavily on modeling, simula- tion, analysis, visualization, and virtual prototyping. The use of new technology to create smarter, more scalable, multifunctional items that are better, cheaper, and more widely used is a key component of global market competition. This type of system development requires methodologies that are both ﬂexible and adaptable due to the wide range of possible applications in ﬁelds such as automotive, aeronautics, robotics, consumer goods, and many more. A mechatronic system is one that combines soft- ware with electronic and mechanical components in a way that is both dynamic and multidisciplinary. A variety of development and integration strategies are emerging from the relevant disciplines in an effort to tackle the inherent complexity of the ﬁeld’s elements. for systems\n\nAn approach to mechatronics design at the system level is necessary due to the exponential growth in device and system complexity in recent years. Engineers can streamline test execution, reuse algorithms in the ﬁnal embedded delivery framework, and integrate mechanical and control design with this method. Innovations funding for healthcare, the life sciences, and renewable energy sources, along with innova- tions in manufacturing gear, are driving this trend at the system level. This method streamlines design, prototyping, and implementation by integrating best practices and existing technologies, which substantially improves the design process. A more streamlined method of production might be implemented by the engineers by dividing the design process into parallel threads. The development of a control algorithm for a mechanical device is used to require the team to wait for a working prototype. Engineers can now begin work more quickly by using a virtual prototype built from concept models and data from simulations. Figure 1 displays the fundamental idea of mechatronics along with present and future mechatronics sectors that have emerged due to technological advancements. Despite the fact that many various visions of the future have been put forth regarding technology and its impact on society, funding is allocated to futurists and tech businesses with the express purpose of predicting the world’s shape in the next ten or ﬁfteen years. 211\n\n212\n\nM."

Seventy-three percent of employers are using\n\nGenAI, with 62% stating that candidates\n\nand employees should have at least some familiarity with it.4 There’s an immediate need for professionals to pursue these skills to\n\nimprove their job readiness—especially as 22%\n\nof recruiting professionals have updated job\n\ndescriptions to reflect the usage of GenAI in the role.5 At the same time, a Deloitte survey found that although Gen Z—who make up a significant\n\nportion of today’s students—expresses some\n\nuncertainty around AI, they’re eager to learn more to align with the future of work.6\n\n2 AI skills like computer vision,\n\nPyTorch, and machine learning\n\n(ML) doubled in enrollments year- over-year, mirroring market demand as AI and ML Specialists roles are expected to grow by 40% over the next four years. Research estimates that AI could add $15.7 trillion in global economic value by 2030.7 Learners have taken substantial strides to upskill and reskill\n\nthemselves through courses like Introduction\n\nto Neural Networks and PyTorch from IBM\n\nand Computer Vision Basics from University\n\nat Buffalo. While employees are utilizing their\n\norganizations’ skill programs to increase their\n\nvalue, students feel the most urgency, with nearly\n\n70% of graduates advocating for foundational GenAI training in their courses.8 This marks a key opportunity for higher education institutions\n\n3 Data ethics skills are a growing\n\npriority for employees and\n\nstudents, more so than job seekers. Data ethics is among the fastest-growing skills\n\non Coursera for employees and students, driven\n\nby the need to responsibly manage and analyze\n\ncustomer data. Despite the importance, there’s\n\nless interest among job seekers, even though\n\n60% of data leaders identify data governance as a primary concern.9 A Deloitte survey found that 78% of organizations prioritize “safe and secure”\n\nAI use as a top ethical principle, marking a 37%\n\nincrease from last year.

        "Cette 15ème édition du rapport présente la couverture la plus large à ce jour en termes de thèmes, de géographie et de secteur. 1000 L'enquête rassemble le point de vue de 1000 chefs d'entreprise. 14 entreprises\n\nCes emploient collectivement plus de 11,3 millions de travailleurs. 22\n\n22 induﬆriels couverts\n\ncluﬆers sont\n\n55 50 pays de toutes les régions du monde\n\nPour la première fois, des résultats sont disponibles pour la Tunisie. Cette enquête a été réalisée par l’IACE, en tant que partenaire oﬃciel du Forum économique mondial, pour le cas spéciﬁque de la Tunisie. 2025\n\nPrincipaux résultats\n\nAu niveau international :\n\nEnviron 22 % des emplois devraient changer d'ici 2030, ce qui inclut 170 millions\n\nd'emplois créés et 92 millions supprimés. L'adoption de nouvelles technologies et l'accès accru au numérique créeront\n\négalement une croissance nette de l'emploi, mais en compensant davantage les pertes\n\n; le ralentissement de la croissance économique, les pénuries d'approvisionnement et\n\nl'inﬂation conﬆituent les risques les plus importants pour l'emploi. Les employeurs interrogés s'attendent à une augmentation particulièrement forte de\n\nla demande de compétences en matière de l'IA et du big data d'ici 2030. Au niveau national :\n\n20 % de changements d’emploi d’ici 2030, contre une moyenne mondiale de 22 %. 2025\n\nRépondre aux déﬁcits de compétences eﬆ considéré comme une priorité essentielle\n\nen Tunisie, 80% des entreprises opérant dans le pays identiﬁant les déﬁcits de\n\ncompétences comme le principal obﬆacle à la transformation de l'entreprise d'ici 2030\n\net 86% visant à améliorer les compétences de leur main-d'œuvre pour répondre aux\n\ntendances clés de l'entreprise. Les entreprises opérant dans le pays identiﬁent l'augmentation du coût de la vie et la\n\nlenteur de la croissance économique comme le principal obﬆacle à la transformation\n\nde l'entreprise d'ici 2030. 85 % visant à améliorer les compétences de leur main-d'œuvre pour répondre aux\n\nprincipales tendances économiques. Les employeurs en Tunisie s’attendent à une augmentation particulièrement forte de\n\nla demande de compétences en matière de leadership et d'inﬂuence sociale, de pensée\n\ncréative et de compétences en matière d'IA et de big data. Sept employeurs sur dix prévoient de ﬁnancer en interne leurs besoins en formation,\n\net environ 40 % visent à tirer parti de modèles de coﬁnancement hybrides, publics et\n\nprivés. 1. Les prévisions des entreprises Tunisiennes quant à l'impact des\n\ngrandes tendances sur leurs activités\n\nLes\n\ntendances anticipées allant de\n\nl'adoption des\n\ntechnologies aux perspectives\n\nmacroéconomiques, en passant par la transition verte, les politique induﬆrielles et les\n\nreﬆrictions commerciales, devraient entraîner une transformation des activités de nos\n\nentreprises tunisiennes au cours des cinq prochaines années. Comme illuﬆré dans la ﬁgure ci-dessus, les entreprises interrogées (à l’échelle international,\n\nrégion MENA et en Tunisie) identiﬁent l'élargissement de l'accès numérique comme la\n\ntendance la plus susceptibles de transformer leur organisation ; ces tendances devraient\n\ninﬂuencer en moyenne 56 % des organisations interrogées. Les tendances macroéconomiques suivantes, à savoir l'augmentation du coût de la vie et la\n\nfaible croissance économique, sont jugées les plus inﬂuentes pour les entreprises Tunisiennes\n\net celle de la région MENA. L'impact des inveﬆissements pour s’adapter au changement climatique a été considéré\n\ncomme la quatrième tendance macroéconomique la plus importante des entreprises\n\ntunisiennes. Les queﬆions sociales et de travail et les conﬂits géopolitiques viennent ensuite. 2. Les Tendances professionnelles anticipées par les entreprises Tunisiennes\n\nLes tendances macroéconomiques et la technologie devraient être à l'origine de perspectives\n\nmitigées en matière de création et de deﬆruction d'emplois au cours des cinq prochaines\n\nannées, dans toutes les catégories d'emploi et dans tous les secteurs d'activité. L'enquête qui a été réalisée donne un aperçu du taux de rotation ﬆructurel du marché du\n\ntravail, à savoir le nombre de nouveaux emplois attendus, plus le nombre de poﬆes qui\n\ndevraient être supprimés au cours de la période, divisé par la taille de la population active en\n\nqueﬆion. Au cours des cinq prochaines années, 170 millions d'emplois devraient être créés et 92\n\nmillions d'emplois déplacés, ce qui représente un changement ﬆructurel du marché du travail\n\nde 22 % des 1,2 milliard d'emplois formels des données étudiés. Cela représente une\n\naugmentation nette de l'emploi de 7 %, soit 78 millions d'emplois.

Les spécialiﬆes de l'IA et de l'apprentissage\n\nautomatique arrivent en tête des emplois à forte croissance. La majorité des poﬆes à\n\ncroissance rapide ﬁgurant sur la liﬆe sont des postes liés à la technologie.

Geﬆion de l'environnement\n\nEn Tunisie : L'IA occupe la première place, suivis par le leadership et l'influence sociale, la\n\npensée créative, et la cybersécurité, soulignant une attention particulière à la geﬆion des\n\ntalents et à l'innovation. Au niveau de la région MENA : Les compétences liées à la cybersécurité et l'IA sont les\n\nplus prioritaires, suivies par la culture technologique et la résilience. La gestion des talents et\n\nla pensée analytique sont également essentielles pour la région. Au niveau mondial : L'IA et la cybersécurité dominent, suivis par la culture technologique\n\net la pensée créative. La curiosité et l'apprentissage continu, ainsi que la geﬆion de\n\nl'environnement, font également partie des priorités globales. En résumé, bien que des compétences comme l'IA, la cybersécurité et la culture\n\ntechnologique soient cruciales partout, chaque région met l'accent sur des aspects spéciﬁques\n\ntels que le leadership et la geﬆion des talents en Tunisie, la pensée syﬆémique au niveau de\n\nla région MENA, et l'apprentissage tout au long de la vie au niveau mondial. Certaines\n\ncompétences essentielles, telles que l'empathie, l'enseignement, le souci du détail, et le\n\nmarketing, semblent maintenir leur pertinence à travers toutes les régions, sans une grande\n\névolution attendue dans leur importance. Ces compétences continueront à être clés pour le\n\ndéveloppement personnel et professionnel, bien que d'autres compétences comme l'IA et la\n\ncybersécurité dominent la croissance dans les prochaines années. 4. Stratégies en matière de main-d'œuvre\n\nLes entreprises tunisiennes interrogées déclarent à une large majorité, qu'inveﬆir dans\n\nl'apprentissage et la formation sur le lieu de travail et automatiser les processus sont les\n\nﬆratégies de main-d'œuvre les plus courantes qui seront adoptées pour atteindre les objectifs\n\ncommerciaux de leur organisation au cours des cinq prochaines années. En complément des ﬆratégies internes qu’elles envisagent pour s’adapter aux évolutions du\n\nmarché de l’emploi, les entreprises expriment également des attentes vis-à-vis de politiques\n\npubliques alignées. D'après les résultats de l’enquête, les mesures les plus susceptibles\n\nd’améliorer l'accès aux talents entre 2025 et 2030 incluent :\n\nLe ﬁnancement de la requaliﬁcation et de l’amélioration des compétences (55 %\n\ndes entreprises). Une plus grande ﬂexibilité dans les pratiques d’embauche et de licenciement (50\n\n%). La modiﬁcation de la législation du travail relative au travail à diﬆance (41 %). L’amélioration des systèmes d’éducation publique (41 %). Ces résultats illuﬆrent une demande claire des entreprises pour un investissement public\n\nrenforcé dans le développement des compétences. L’objectif eﬆ d’assurer une meilleure\n\nadéquation entre la main-d’œuvre disponible et les besoins évolutifs de l’économie. Dans un contexte marqué par des facteurs émergents tels que la fragmentation\n\ngéoéconomique croissante, l’augmentation du coût de la vie et l’adoption massive des outils\n\nd’IA sur le marché du travail, les grandes tendances mondiales façonnent un environnement\n\nde plus en plus complexe. Dans ce cadre, les décideurs politiques, les employeurs et les\n\ntravailleurs doivent naviguer dans une incertitude persiﬆante. Cependant, le rapport souligne\n\ndes perspectives d’emploi mondiales fortement positives, accompagnées d’une réduction\n\nprogressive des compétences devenues obsolètes. Cela s'explique par l’impact tangible des\n\ninitiatives de requaliﬁcation, d’amélioration des compétences et de redéploiement mises en\n\nœuvre ces dernières années, qui commencent à se reﬂéter dans les données et à transformer\n\nla main-d'œuvre aux niveaux national et mondial. Le gap de compétences demeure le principal frein à la transformation pour la majorité de nos\n\nentreprises (80% des entreprises interrogées, à cet effet, il eﬆ nécessaire de :\n\nMettre en place des transitions professionnelles proactives et dynamiques dans un éventail\n\ncroissant de rôles professionnels. (Identiﬁcation des compétences émergentes, syﬆème de\n\nrequaliﬁcation,)\n\nAdopter un équilibre futur entre l’automatisation accrue et une augmentation des\n\ncompétences humaines (complémentarité homme-machine, optimiser l’automatisation...). Ces enjeux soulignent l'importance de politiques et de ﬆratégies collaboratives pour\n\nsurmonter les déﬁs liés à l’évolution rapide des exigences du marché du travail. ACE FO I BETTER THINKING ..."

A JOB ADVERTISEMENT ANALYSIS\n\nIbrahim Halil Gerek Adana Science and Technology University, Turkey ihgerek@adanabtu.edu.tr\n\nIbrahim Efe Efeoglu Adana Science and Technology University, Turkey e.efeoglu@adanabtu.edu.tr\n\nAbstract: The Turkish construction sector has been developing day by day. According to the sources it has moved into second place in the world after China. Turkish companies have been constructing many buildings all over the world. In light of these developments, Turkish construction companies now require civil engineers to have different and higher level skills than in the past. This paper examines the knowledge, skills and competencies demanded of early career civil engineer graduates through a content analysis of job advertisements. The study focuses particularly on jobs which are appropriate for civil engineers with three or fewer years of working experience. The job advertisement data was gathered from January 2011 to March 2011. Our analysis shows that a wide variety of job titles require a high level of technical knowledge and competency as well as strong communication skills. This paper briefly situates this study in the literature, describes the research method - essentially the collection and content analysis of job ads - and then presents the results. It concludes with a consideration of the issues arising, particularly the role of entry level positions in preparing their incumbents for more senior positions in the future. Keywords: civil engineers, knowledge and skills, job advertisements, qualifications\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nBecause of rapid changes in today’s labor market, employees must be able to adapt to new conditions. Adapting to change requires a set of skills and competencies beyond technical skills. Job advertisement analysis studies became widespread in recent years to identify the qualifications needed for different professions. By focusing on information systems jobs and their requirements for IS graduates, Kennan et al.(2007), determined what Australian employers currently require in terms of IS knowledge, skills, competencies and any other traits such as communication skills or personal characteristics. Choi and Rasmussen (2009) examined on qualifications needed for digital library positions in academic libraries by studying job advertisements. They showed that library professionals need qualifications in management, skills in communication, and proficiency in with digital technology. In her paper investigating the knowledge and skills required by employers of recordkeeping professionals, Pember (2003) concluded that employers expect recordkeeping professionals to possess a diverse range of recordkeeping knowledge and experience. She also indicated that recordkeeping positions often require knowledge and experience in several areas of information management. Recordkeeping professionals must have a high level of computer literacy, well developed communication and interpersonal skills, staff management skills and experience, well developed team skills, and a strong customer focus. Personal attributes such as enthusiasm and motivation as well as analytical and problem solving skills were also highly valued."

        "These skills are also sought after in many other professions. Similar studies were conducted for the civil engineering profession (Angelides, 2003). In this study we aimed to find out skills and competencies required for civil engineers. When engineering history is investigated, it can be seen that civil engineering is the second oldest engineering discipline after military engineering. The focus of civil engineering is site and soil analysis and the design of a building’s foundation, structure, and surrounding paved areas, as well as the appropriate, site-condition based design of its underground utilities such as storm, water, sewer, and electrical services (Levy, 2009). Civil Engineering has subdisciplines such as environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering, water resource engineering, coastal engineering, materials engineering, and surveying. An owner will often to require the services of one or more of these engineering specialists on his or her project (Levy, 2009). A number of studies have tracked the changes in the knowledge, skills and competencies required of civil engineers over time. Baron (2001) indicated in his study outlining a proactive approach for today’s civil engineers that those training for the profession today should not only be equipped with knowledge of technical issues but should also be familiar with other areas such as quality management, risk management, new information technologies, as well as environmental, management, social, ethical, political, and legal issues. In his study, Arroyo (2001) essentially proposes the establishment of an academic and a professional path, stressing the importance of developing skills in teamwork, initiative and management ability in civil engineers. The development of personal qualities’ necessary for the execution of technical and non-technical duties throughout an engineer’s professional life was stated by Economopoulos (2001). He also emphasized the importance of Continuous Professional Development (CPD) of Civil Engineers as a planned acquisition of knowledge, experience and skills. Through the analysis of job advertisements, this paper aims to identify what construction companies currently require in terms of civil engineering knowledge, skills and competencies as well as any other expressed requirements such as communication skills or personal characteristics. 2. RESEARCH METHOD\n\nTo identify what skills and competencies are required by employers, a number of approaches can be used (Liteck et al., 2004). The unobtrusive method of job advertisement analysis was chosen for this study in the belief that a broad sweep could be achieved with quite limited resources. The job advertisement data was gathered from January 2011 to March 2011. Two major Turkish online job lists were used – Kariyer.net (http://www.secretcv.com) and Secretcv.com (http://www.secretcv.com). 427 job ads were analyzed. Collected data from the two web pages is listed according to date, job title, employer, job setting, location, educational requirements, and years’ experience. These qualifications were analyzed and tabulated in five areas: technical skills, computer skills, language skills, and interpersonal skills. 3. RESULTS\n\nAdvertised positions have been grouped into a number of categories according to the requirements listed by employers. Table 1 presents these categories. Although advertisements analyzed listed jobs in the field of civil engineering, only 40,98% included the term “civil engineer”. The other 59,02% provided a detailed description of a job suiting a civil engineer (such as Site and Soils Analyst) without actually mentioning the discipline of civil engineering. The description of position titles in detail can be considered a new trend. On the other hand, greater consciousness of health and safety issues as well as legal regulations have created positions such as Health and Safety Engineer. The other significant finding in Table 1 is the percentage of civil engineers working as sales representatives. In recent years the number of civil engineers who have been working as sales engineer has increased due to the preferences of those companies which produce construction materials. Table 1: Considered position titles in ads\n\nPosition Title Civil Engineer Site manager Sales Engineer Technical Office Engineer Site Engineer Project Manager Health and Safety Engineer Others\n\nN 175 53\n\n43 42 30 30 20 34\n\nP (%) 40,98 12,41\n\n10,07 9,84 7,03 7,03 4,68 7,96\n\nTotal\n\n427\n\n100,00\n\nThis study treats experience in a particular field as well as work experience as technical skills. Findings from this content analysis show that the skill set most frequently mentioned by employers in job advertisements is technical skills (78%). The next most often mentioned is computer skills (%55), followed by language skills (%49), and interpersonal skills (%44). Table 2: Considered experience fields in job ads\n\nExperience Fields Cost estimation and bidding Planning and Inspection Design Dam Construction Building Construction Industrial Construction Road and transportation Cons.

According to this table, experience in cost estimation and bidding is the most highly demanded field (%21.78). One of the reasons for this is the rapid growth projects with large, multi-million dollar budgets. Government investments in different projects need accurate technical and financial estimations. Another significant figure in this table is required marketing and sales experience. In this day and age, most companies in different sectors are focusing on marketing and sales. The same trend is prevalent in the construction\n\nindicates\n\nthat experience\n\nfields were\n\nthe most commonly mentioned attribute\n\nsector. Companies that produce construction materials have been particularly prefer civil engineers as marketing and sales employees. Table 3: Civil Engineers’ work experience in job ads\n\nNot Required Required\n\nNo specific years Less than 3 years 4-5 years 6-10 years More than 10 years\n\nN 172 255 37 45 89 57 27 427\n\nP (%) 40,28 59,72 8,67 10,54 20,84 13,35 6,32 100\n\nTotal\n\nIn terms of civil engineers’ work experience, almost two third of the job ads (59,72%) for civil engineer positions give place to work experience, while 40,28% job ads do not. As Table 3 indicates, one third of job ads (34,19%) ask for work between 4 and 10 years of work experience. This may be a result of the increase in large and costly projects which require experienced civil engineers. Another reason may be the idea that experienced civil engineers make better decisions than inexperienced ones. Table 4: Considered computer skills in ads\n\nComputer Skills\n\nMS Office AutoCAD, Primavera MS Project SAP 2000-STA 4 CAD, X-Steel\n\nN 217 165 46 46 31\n\nP (%) 50,82 38,64 10,77 10,77 7,26\n\nTechnology use is an important part of civil engineer. Computer software packages can be used for many tasks, such as collecting, storing, analyzing, and displaying data. Table 4 indicates the computer skills required by employers. When all job ads were considered, in more than half (55,03%) proficiency in at least one computer programme was needed. Note that the total is more than 100% because some employers ask for knowledge of more than one computer programme. An ad might, for example, require competency with both MS Office and Primavera. The most frequently mentioned required or preferred programmes were MS Office (50,82%) and AutoCAD (38,64%). For over a decade, the relative importance of the top four skills (spreadsheets, word processors, CAD, electronic communication) has remained unchanged, indicating some stability in these computing skills in civil engineering. A study conducted by the American Society of Civil Engineers’ Task Committee on Computing Education found that the use of Computer-aided Design (CAD) and Spreadsheet software were the most important programs to both educators and practitioners, a result which our study corroborates (as shown in Table 4). Because much civil engineering work requires computer knowledge, the ability to use computer programmes is essential today (Abudayyeh, 2004). Table 5: Considered computer skills in ads\n\nLanguage Skills\n\nEnglish Arabic Deutch Total\n\nN 218 13 4 235\n\nP (%)\n\n51,05 3,04 0,94 55,03\n\nAmong qualifications stated in the ads, more than half (55,03%) stated a preference for foreign language knowledge. As can be seen from Table 5, the demand for knowledge of English is the most significant (51,05%). Recent economic developments in the Turkish economy and the effects of\n\nglobalization have enabled Turkish construction companies to do business all over the world. Especially in terms of foreign contracting, the period from 2003 to 2008 has been a brilliant success story. While the annual amount of new contracts for Turkish contractors was only $1,7 billion in 2002, at the end of 2008 the amount reached $23,6 billion. In 2009, five thousand projects were been carried out in 70 countries, and the total volume of international business reached $130 billion (TCA, 2009). Table 6: Considered interpersonal skills in ads\n\nTeam oriented Management skills Communication skills Ability to think analytical Adaptable to flexible working hours Taking responsibility Problem solving and decision making Innovative\n\nN 101 64 58 39 31 27 19 6\n\nP (%) 23,65 14,99 13,58 9,13 7,26 6,32 4,45 1,41\n\nAlmost half of the ads listed skills which can be considered interpersonal skills or soft skills (194, 45.43%). The most frequently occurring among these is being team oriented, found in 101 (23.65%) of the advertisements. This shows the importance of teamwork in construction projects. In addition, as Table 6 indicates, management skills and communication skills are also important for civil engineers and their employers, likely because most civil engineers work with others and have subordinates. Parallel to these findings, Al-Khafaji et al.’s (2003) study presenting points of attention and drivers for a civil engineering program for the 21st century consistent with the U.S. ABET EC2000 accreditation requirements emphasizes that civil engineering education in the future should equip its students with knowledge of and skills in leadership, innovation and creativity, marketing, teamwork, communication, economics, social and environmental issues, and international context. One striking result of our study is the lack of importance given to innovation. Only 6 (1.41%) employers included being innovative in their ads. Table 7: Considered other requirements in ads\n\nRequirements Military Service No obstacle to travel No obstacle to work abroad Working Abroad Advanced Education (Master Degree) Graduated University\n\nN 210 160 37 52 7 23\n\nP (%) 49,18 37,47 8,67 12,18 1,64 5,39\n\nTable 7 shows other requirements asked for by employers. According to this, having no obstacle to travel is in the highest demand after military service. Globalization trends are creating a world environment which facilitates global opportunities for the civil engineers. A construction company can do business in different countries simultaneously, or focus on different countries at different times. Parallel to this situation, having no obstacle to working abroad is also a significant result. Job advertisements rarely mention an advanced degree as a requirement. Only seven (1.64%) of the ads our study examined mentioned an advanced degree. That may be because of the belief that after a bachelor’s degree, experience is considered more than graduate education. In 5.39% of ads, a preference for graduates of a particular university is expressed. This is a result of the reputation for training highly qualified engineers which some universities have developed. 4. CONCLUSION\n\nThis paper represents the results of an investigation of the skills and competencies required by today’s construction companies in ads, with a particular focus on technical, computer, language, and interpersonal skills. According to the analysis, it is technical skills that employers mention most often in job ads. The other most frequently mentioned skills are, in order of descending frequency, computer skills, language skills, and interpersonal skills. The rapid growth in big projects and government investment in new construction requires good technical and financial estimation. As a result, cost estimation and bidding is the most demanded experience field. Computer usage in civil engineering is growing rapidly. The need for computer skills is clearly shown in the results of this study. In more than half of advertisements analyzed knowledge of at least one computer programme was needed. In particular, Civil engineers should have knowledge of programmes such as MS Office and AutoCAD. Foreign language skills are also important for Turkish civil engineers. Those Turkish civil engineers who plan to have a career globally should learn at least one foreign language, particularly English. According to this study, interpersonal skills and technical skills are both very important. Almost half of the ads mention interpersonal skills. This is likely a reflection of the collaborative nature of most civil engineering projects. The most frequently occurring interpersonal skill asked for is being team oriented. Management skills and communication skills are also highly valued. In civil engineering education, classes which include topics related to these fields will be very helpful for students’ future careers. One striking result of our study is the frequency with which advertisements give place to positions related to sales and marketing. The number of civil engineers who work as sales engineer is increasing. This can be considered a new trend. Companies that produce construction materials prefer sales engineers who have detailed knowledge of these materials. The needs of the Turkish construction industry, in terms of knowledge, skills and attitudes of its employees, parallel trends worldwide. As Da Fonseca (2001)indicated, in the 21st century, civil engineers should be equipped with both a good knowledge of the basic sciences as well as knowledge and skills related to topics such as decision making, communication, computers, foreign languages, microeconomics, finance and accounting. It is hoped that the results of this study can be utilized both by civil engineers and civil engineering departments of Engineering Faculties to design curricula for their students.

Recruitment in the Middle East is experiencing a period of rapid transformation, driven by economic shifts, technological advancements, and evolving workforce expectations. As industries in the region diversify and expand, recruitment strategies are becoming more sophisticated, aiming to meet new demands and harness emerging opportunities. This article will explore the current trends shaping recruitment in the Middle East, the challenges businesses face, and the key factors influencing the future of recruitment in the region. Economic Diversification and the Shift in Talent Demand\n\nHistorically, the Middle East has been synonymous with oil and gas, but in recent years, countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar have been aggressively diversifying their economies. This shift has a direct impact on recruitment, as sectors such as technology, healthcare, finance, and tourism grow in importance. A notable trend is the increasing demand for tech talent. As digital transformation accelerates across industries, there is a growing need for skilled professionals in data analytics, software development, and cybersecurity. Additionally, industries like fintech, e-commerce, and artificial intelligence (AI) are experiencing rapid expansion, creating a wealth of new job opportunities in the region. For businesses in the Middle East, the challenge lies in attracting candidates with the right skills to meet these changing needs. The rise of these emerging industries is reshaping the talent pool, requiring companies to adopt innovative recruitment practices to identify and secure top talent in these high-demand fields. Technological Transformation in Recruitment\n\nTechnology has reshaped every aspect of our lives, and recruitment in the Middle East is no exception. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in recruitment is on the rise, with companies leveraging AI tools to streamline processes such as resume screening, candidate assessments, and predictive analytics. These tools help recruiters make faster and more informed decisions, significantly reducing the time spent on manual tasks. Furthermore, digital platforms like LinkedIn and online job portals have made it easier for businesses to connect with a larger pool of candidates. With remote work now more widely accepted, the Middle East is increasingly hiring talent from beyond its borders. These platforms allow recruiters to access global talent, providing them with a broader selection of candidates, particularly for specialized roles in IT and finance. The digital shift also impacts how companies approach employer branding. Candidates are now researching employers online before applying, making it crucial for businesses to present themselves as attractive workplaces. Developing a positive online presence and showcasing company culture are key elements in attracting top talent. The Growing Demand for Flexibility and Remote Work\n\nOne of the most significant shifts in the workforce is the growing demand for flexibility. Employees in the Middle East, especially in sectors like IT and digital marketing, are increasingly looking for hybrid or remote work options. This trend is not just a passing phase but rather a fundamental shift in how people view work-life balance. As businesses recognize the benefits of remote work, including access to a global talent pool and cost savings, many are adopting flexible working arrangements. This change presents a new\n\nopportunity for recruitment in the Middle East, allowing companies to tap into talent from around the world. Remote work policies also enable employers to compete for international candidates, offering more diverse and specialized skills than might be available locally. The Focus on Employee Well-being and Corporate Culture\n\nAnother key trend in recruitment in the Middle East is the growing emphasis on employee well- being. Candidates are increasingly looking for employers that offer more than just a salary; they want companies that prioritize mental health, offer competitive benefits, and maintain a positive corporate culture. Businesses are responding by investing in wellness programs, flexible work policies, and career development opportunities. The ability to attract and retain talent now depends not just on financial incentives but also on creating an environment where employees feel valued, supported, and engaged. Challenges Facing Recruitment in the Middle East\n\nDespite the exciting opportunities, recruitment in the Middle East comes with its own set of challenges. One of the main obstacles is the skills gap. While many industries are growing, there is a lack of qualified local talent in emerging sectors like AI, cybersecurity, and fintech. Companies often find themselves competing for a limited pool of candidates, especially for specialized roles. In addition, the region’s reliance on expatriates remains a factor in recruitment. While countries like Saudi Arabia are actively promoting local talent through nationalization initiatives such as Saudization, expatriates still make up a significant portion of the workforce. For businesses, this means navigating complex visa processes and ensuring compliance with local labor laws. Moreover, cultural sensitivity plays a crucial role in recruitment. The Middle East is home to a diverse mix of cultures, and understanding local customs and expectations is key to building strong relationships with candidates. Businesses need to be mindful of these cultural nuances when recruiting talent, particularly for client-facing roles. The Future of Recruitment in the Middle East\n\nThe future of recruitment in the Middle East looks promising, with several key trends likely to dominate the next few years. First, the ongoing expansion of non-oil sectors will continue to drive demand for skilled professionals, particularly in tech, finance, and healthcare. As industries evolve, so too will recruitment strategies, with an increasing focus on digital recruitment tools and data-driven hiring processes. Another important development is the continued shift toward flexible and remote work. As more companies adopt hybrid models, recruitment will need to adapt to accommodate candidates who may not be based in the region but can still contribute to businesses’ growth and success. This shift will likely lead to more global talent being hired for roles in the Middle East, expanding the talent pool beyond local borders. Furthermore, as businesses in the region place greater emphasis on employee well-being, it’s expected that the recruitment process will evolve to include a stronger focus on finding candidates who align with an organization’s values and culture. This will help companies not only attract the best talent but also ensure that they retain their top performers. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of Recruitment in the Middle East\n\nRecruitment in the Middle East is evolving at a rapid pace. With emerging industries, the rise of digital technologies, and a growing focus on employee well-being, the recruitment landscape is becoming more competitive and diverse. Employers must stay agile and adapt their strategies to attract the best talent in this dynamic environment. As the region continues to develop, staying ahead of recruitment trends and leveraging new technologies will be crucial for companies seeking to thrive. Whether you’re a business looking to expand your team or a job seeker exploring new opportunities, understanding the trends shaping recruitment in the Middle East will give you a competitive edge in this rapidly evolving job market.

Fastest-Growing Jobs of the Future\n\nFastest-Growing and Fastest-Declining Jobs\n\nAs automation and sustainability redefine the global economy, the following roles are poised to experience significant demand:\n\n1. AI and Machine Learning Specialists\n\n2. Sustainability Specialists\n\n3. Business Intelligence Analysts\n\n4. Information Security Analysts\n\n5. Fintech Engineers\n\n6. Data Analysts and Scientists\n\n7. Robotics Engineers\n\n8. Renewable Energy Engineers\n\n9. Agriculture Equipment Operators\n\n10. Digital Transformation Specialists\n\nThese jobs reflect two critical drivers of change: the rise of artificial intelligence and the growing focus on sustainability. For instance, AI specialists are expected to see demand grow by 40%, adding over one million new roles as organizations race to adopt advanced technologies. Similarly, roles such as Sustainability Specialists and Renewable Energy Engineers are set to grow by over 30%, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change. Declining Roles in the Age of Automation\n\nDigitalization and automation are expected to impact clerical and administrative roles the most. Jobs such as:\n\nBank Tellers\n\nPostal Service Clerks\n\nCashiers and Ticket Clerks\n\nData Entry Clerks\n\n…are projected to decline rapidly, with record-keeping and administrative roles anticipated to see 26 million fewer positions by 2027. ## The Automation Effect\n\nBy 2027, 42% of business tasks will be automated, up from 34% today. Machines are increasingly taking on activities such as data processing, decision-making, and coordination— tasks previously dominated by humans. As artificial intelligence becomes a key enabler, 75% of companies surveyed plan to integrate AI into their operations. Emerging Growth Areas\n\nGreen Jobs\n\nThe transition to renewable energy is fueling demand for roles in sustainability and climate mitigation. Jobs like Environment Protection Professionals and Solar Energy System Engineers are projected to grow rapidly, reflecting the global push for cleaner energy solutions. Social and Agriculture Roles\n\nJobs in education, healthcare, and agriculture are also set to expand. Rising demand for care- related professions, combined with advancements in agricultural technology and investments in climate adaptation, are driving growth in these sectors. The Skills of Tomorrow\n\nTop Skills Required in the Digital Age\n\nAs job roles evolve, so do the skills required to excel in them. The most sought-after skills in the digital age include:\n\nCognitive Skills: Analytical and creative thinking. Self-Efficacy Skills: Resilience, flexibility, motivation, and lifelong learning. Interpersonal Skills: Empathy, active listening, and leadership. Technological Skills: Technological literacy and big data utilization. Despite the rising demand for skills enhancement, many companies are cutting training budgets due to costs. Only half of workers today have access to adequate training, even as six in 10 require upskilling. Here, eLearning platforms—which have seen a 400% rise in demand since the pandemic—present a cost-effective and scalable solution. Thriving in the Future of Work\n\nIn the future of work, jobs related to technology and sustainability will dominate. Embracing lifelong learning and acquiring cutting-edge skills will be crucial to staying competitive and avoiding job displacement. Companies must also invest in employee training and foster a culture of adaptability to prepare for the opportunities ahead. By understanding these trends and proactively addressing challenges, we can navigate the complexities of the future of work, ensuring that individuals and economies alike are positioned to thrive in a rapidly changing world. Although skills enhancement has become more critical, companies have been ironically cutting their training budgets due to the increasing cost of training programs. “Six in 10 workers will require training before 2027, but only half of workers are seen to have access to adequate training opportunities today,” the report said. Here, eLearning, which has enjoyed a 400% rise in demand since the pandemic, is seen as a game changer, and a more cost-efficient alternative for upskilling. The Future of Jobs Report 2025\n\nEvery year, the World Economic Forum brings together the perspectives of 1000 leading global employers - representative of around 14 million workers - to provide a view of how macrotrends have an impact on jobs and skills. These trends by themselves, which include technological, geoeconomic, economic uncertainty and demographic shifts - can tell us a lot about the job market, but collectively can give us a far more holistic picture. Importantly, they also provide some interesting, data-led predictions for the future that provide a horizontal slice of what employers may be thinking about. For employers and employees alike, the challenge is in deciphering what these trends mean for them. For example, the World Economic Forum notes that digital access is expected to be the most transformative trend - with adoption and advancements in technologies to be a key focus for all businesses. This is already having a critical impact on the emerging skills gap and employers' strategies and methods for upskilling. According to the report, 59 of every 100 workers will need training by 2030 to stay competitive. From these two pointers alone, it doesn't take much of a guess to determine which skills will be the focus of upskilling, and which ones will be most highly in demand on the market as we move through 2025. A few key takeaways from the Future of Jobs Report 2025 that we have taken from a Freshminds perspective:\n\nTech and green jobs are booming: We should expect to see more Big Data Specialists,\n\nAI experts, Renewable Energy Engineers, and similar roles requested by our partners and clients. Skills are changing rapidly: Workers need to adapt, with 39% of current skills set to become outdated by 2030. This number has shrunk, however, suggesting that L&D is picking up - a good sign for internal investment by employers in their people. Analytical thinking is key: Employers highly value analytical skills, resilience, and leadership. Analytical thinking still remains the most sought-after skill among employers (7/10 companies consider it essential in 2025). This is followed by resilience, flexibility and agility. AI and tech skills are in demand: AI & data are the fastest growing skillsets in demand, closely followed by networks & cybersecurity, and technology literacy. Complementing these, creative thinking, resilience, flexibility and agility are also expected to continue to rise in importance\n\nUpskilling is essential: 59 out of every 100 workers will need training by 2030 to stay\n\ncompetitive. The most prominent skills differentiating growing from declining jobs are anticipated to comprise resilience, flexibility and agility; resource management and operations; quality control; programming and technological literacy. Geoeconomic fragmentation and geopolitical tensions are expected to drive business\n\nmodel transformation - the Report cited one-third (34%) of surveyed organisations expected to transform in the next five years. Skills gaps are considered the biggest barrier to business transformation - apparently, 63% of employers are identifying them as a major barrier over the 2025-2030 period. 70% of employers are expecting to hire staff with new skills.

Abstract. Professional Skills is the basic requirement that all engineers need to master in the current job market. This study was conducted throughout peninsular Malaysia using the Soft Skills Model introduced by the Ministry of Education (MoE). Among the objectives of this study is the level of requirement of the Soft Skills (SS) element to produce a competitive Mechanical Engineer and identify the most dominant Soft Skills needed in the current job market against Mechanical Engineers. The questionnaire distributed to respondents and data was analysed using XL-STAT 2014 software to obtain Discriminant Analysis (DA) to achieve the objective of the study. The overall percentage for (SS) elements is 91% respectively. This study will be a complementary set for the students of Mechanical Engineering in Malaysia. Mastering the features required by the industry makes it easy for students to put themselves in the real job world. 1. Introduction Soft Skills The Ministry of Education (MoE) has emphasised on standard methods and objectives to measure the students' soft skills. Among the elements emphasised are psychomotor, communication, English proficiency, leadership, ethics, spirituality and emotional intelligence. All universities need to incorporate these elements into the program's learning outcomes to evaluate student achievement [1]. Soft skills, generic skills and employability skills refer to modern engineering graduates [2] who need to be skilful in every aspect of this skill if they want to succeed at work then carry out successful work at the workplace [3] in helping to improve the capabilities of a company [4]. It is the primary asset for any workforce at the professional level, manager or business owner [5].

Soft Skills Model\n\n1\n\nICE&ICIE 2019 IOP Conf. Series: Materials Science and Engineering 697 (2019) 012016\n\nIOP Publishing doi:10.1088/1757-899X/697/1/012016\n\nBased on Figure 1, there are seven elements of Soft Skills outlined by (MoE) for reference of all universities. i. Communication Skills: through effective communication skills, one will try to absorb and adapt [6] with news or situation that has the potential to reduce concerns and improve performance [7] as claimed by employers to meet high market demands in the industry employment [8] especially engineering graduates [9]. ii. Critical Thinking and Problem Solving Skills: reform in education is now increasingly focusing on essential processes of thinking, including problem-solving items [10,11]. Critical thinking and judgment are needed for engineering at a professional level to solve workplace problems [12,13]. Critical thinking is a step to make assumptions, testing of legitimacy, seeing things from different points of view, and taking into account every action [14,15,16]. As future graduates, university students need to equip themselves with critical thinking and problem- solving skills [17,18] as this is the focus of employers in hiring a new workforce [19]. iii. Teamwork Skills: teamwork is a high-level need that needs to be addressed [20]. Students believe that they are studying teamwork skills through the curriculum approach [21], joining sports teams or volunteers to work in an organisation that does not involve profit [22]. iv. Continuous Learning and Information Management: through the development of the methods used by incorporating the adapted learning, it can address the various learning styles of students and improve the effectiveness of the use of technology and information management [23]. v. Entrepreneurial Skills: nowadays, entrepreneurial skills are considered the ideal strategy for expanding productivity and overall development of any organisation [24] and being recognised as one of the critical skills [25], among engineering graduates [26]. Graduates not only have business opportunities and manage their businesses but also to create jobs for others [27,28,29]. vi. Professional Ethics and Moral: professional ethics is the best practice for all engineering students and engineering practitioners and advisable to stick to this principle [30] for the well-being of society which is the essence of engineering profession [31]. vii. Leadership Skills: essential skills are personality skills that are related to interpersonal skills such as leadership skills [32,33] that can develop the quality of competent leadership skills [34]. Based on the Program Outcomes (PO), engineering students are expected to master the skills, knowledge and attitudes through programs offered. That includes the following items: i. Engineering Knowledge; ii. Problem Analysis; iii. Design/Development of Solutions; iv. Investigation; v. Modern Tool Usage; vi. The Engineer and Society; vii. Environment and Sustainability; viii. Ethics; ix. Communication; x. Individual and Team Work; xi. Life-Long Learning; and xii. Project Management and Finance [35]. The items contained in (PO) are closely related to the employability of mechanical engineering graduates also involve the professional skills required by the industry. 2. Materials and methods The research was conducted throughout the Peninsular of Malaysia. It is also involved in Mechanical Engineering industrial activities. A set of questionnaires is distributed by researchers to obtain feedback from industry, employers and organisations involved in the process of finding and securing the workforce in this field. All surveys have distributed, updated into XL-Stat software. All of the data generated, and the results of the study included Descriptive Statistics (DS) and Discriminant Analysis (DA). 3.

Tableau 3: Evolution du taux de chômage par gouvernorat 2016-2019\n\nSource : INS\n\n10\n\nConscient qu’il faut des mesures d’urgence à ce problème, l’IACE a abordé la question de\n\nl’emploi sous ses deux angles : offre et demande. Il s’agit particulièrement de donner des éléments de réponse aux questions suivantes :\n\no A combien s’élève la demande d’emploi potentielle des entreprises ? o Existe –t-il des postes effectivement vacants ? o Y’a –t-il un problème de qualité de la main d’œuvre ou un problème d’offre (pénurie) ? o Comment les entreprises arrivent-elles à recruter ? o Est-ce que l’université est en cohérence avec la demande sur le marché du travail ? o Pour qui l’université forme –t-elle ? o Quelle est la situation actuelle des diplômés ? o Par quels moyens cherchent-ils le premier poste ? Afin de répondre à ces interrogations, l’IACE a mené une enquête adressée d’une part au chefs\n\nd’entreprises et ce, afin d’analyser le marché de travail coté demande. D’autre part, une enquête a été\n\nmenée auprès des diplômés afin de comprendre le marché de travail coté offre. En se basant sur l’enquête menée auprès des diplômés, un guide d’orientation selon les délais\n\nd’attente au moins pour une première insertion professionnelle a été élaboré. La méthodologie\n\nadoptée pour ce guide sera présentée ci-dessous. 11\n\nMéthodologie adoptée\n\nL’IACE a conduit une étude, sur le marché de l’offre et de la demande de travail en Tunisie, basée sur deux\n\nenquêtes à savoir :\n\nUne enquête auprès d’un échantillon représentatif de 1 200 entreprises privées (employant 20 employés et\n\nplus, tout secteur confondu) appartenant à 20 secteurs d’activités et réparties sur 24 gouvernorats. Pour ce\n\nfaire une enquête en face à face a été adoptée. Une enquête auprès d’un échantillon représentatif de 10 000 diplômés du supérieur ayant obtenu leurs\n\ndiplômes de licence entre 2008 et 2018. Cette enquête a été menée à travers un formulaire en ligne partagé\n\nsur les réseaux sociaux.

La stratification s’effectue\n\nsuivant les 24 gouvernorats de la Tunisie et les 8 secteurs spécifiés telle qu’elle a été adoptée dans\n\nl’édition 2018 du RNE. Afin de répondre aux exigences d’une enquête nationale statistiquement fiable, IACE s’est basé sur le\n\ntravail de fond réalisé par l’INS dans le cadre du RNE (Registre National des Entreprises) qui répertorie\n\nles entreprises formelles. Le tirage de l’échantillon a été sollicité auprès de l’INS qui fournit la liste exacte des entreprises-\n\néchantillon à interroger, comprenant leurs contacts : nomination, adresse, téléphone… reparties sur\n\nles 24 gouvernorats. 12\n\nLa taille totale de l’échantillon de l’enquête « entreprises » est de 1 200 entreprises de 20 employés\n\net plus, sur un total de 7223 entreprises inscrites au Répertoire Nationale des Entreprises (RNE) ; Soit\n\nun taux de sondage global de 17 pour cent. Pour l’année 2018, les entreprises de 20 employés et plus représentent 1 pourcent du total des\n\nentreprises en Tunisie et emploient 76 pour cent de l’emploi salarié (803 465 personnes).

Un intérêt particulier a été accordé à ce volet en demandant aux chefs d’entreprises de\n\nnous préciser leur perception à l’adéquation entre les compétences des demandeurs d’emploi et les\n\ncompétences requises pour un poste vacant, et ceci en attribuant une note de 1 à 10 pour chaque\n\ncritère étudié et les résultats étaient comme suit :\n\nGraphique 3 : Les notes accordées par les chefs d’entreprises aux différentes compétences\n\nQualité de la formation professionnelle\n\nCompétences transversales\n\nCompétences techniques\n\nQualité de la formation universitaire\n\n6,49\n\n6,44\n\n6,38\n\n5,86\n\nSource : Enquête statistiques sur l’emploi, IACE (2019)\n\n5. L’adéquation entre l’offre et la demande\n\nAprès avoir évalué les compétences requises, nous avons établi un score d‘adéquation entre les\n\nbesoins du marché de l’emploi, représentés par les compétences sollicitées par les entreprises et\n\nl’offre de l’emploi représentée par les profils recrutés. Ce score est considéré comme très important\n\nvu le problème d’inadéquation posé sur le marché du travail et qui touche surtout les nouveaux\n\ndiplômés. Il sera important donc d’évaluer cette adéquation par gouvernorat. Les scores par gouvernorat étaient comme présentés dans le tableau suivant. La moyenne nationale\n\nde ce score s’élève à 0,43.

        "Les postes vacants\n\n1. Analyse des postes vacants\n\nUne analyse détaillée des postes vacants par secteur nous a permis de conclure que le nombre de\n\npostes vacants s’élève à 47 026 et sont concentrés dans les deux secteurs « Industrie » et\n\n« Services ». Les figures ci-dessous présentent les postes vacants dans les 8 secteurs étudiés. Figure 5 : les postes vacants par secteur\n\nIndustrie\n\n31885\n\nServices\n\n5860\n\nCommerce\n\n3039\n\nConstruction\n\n2372\n\nHébergement et Restauration\n\n2184\n\nAgriculture et pêche\n\n632\n\nInformation et Communication\n\n561\n\nTransport et entreposage\n\n494\n\nSource : Enquête statistiques sur l’emploi, IACE (2019)\n\nCes postes vacants peuvent être classés selon la profession. Nous avons respecté la nomenclature\n\nde l’INS des professions pour pouvoir évaluer les postes vacants par profession et interroger les chefs\n\nd’entreprises. Et les résultats étaient comme présentés dans le tableau ci-dessous :\n\n27\n\nGraphique 6 : Répartition des postes vacants par profession demandée3\n\nSource : Enquête statistiques sur l’emploi, IACE (2019)\n\nNote : professions intermédiaires (Membres de l'exécutif et du corps législatif, Professions paramédicales, …)\n\nLa nomenclature des professions détaillée est présentée dans les annexes. Une lecture plus approfondie nous a permis de déduire que pour les professions élémentaires les plus\n\ndemandées relatives au secteur de l’industrie, sont les emballeurs à la main et autres manœuvres des\n\nindustries du secteur de la confection. Pour avoir un aperçu général sur les différents postes vacants par gouvernorat, une analyse plus\n\napprofondie a été effectuée comme présentée si dessous. En se basant sur les résultats, nous pouvons conclure que les deux régions qui dégagent plus de\n\nnombre des postes vacants sont le District du Grand Tunis (32,5%) et le Centre Est (31,8%) comme\n\nprésenté par le tableau suivant. La région de centre Ouest, ne dégage que 0,2% du nombre total des\n\n3 Les professions élémentaires sont des professions qui ne demandent ni une qualification professionnelle ni académique. Pour le secteur de l’industrie, il s’agit des tâches préliminaires telles que le ramassage et le pré processus industriel. Pour les autres sociétés touristiques, la demande consiste essentiellement à recruter des\n\nfemmes de ménages, des chasseurs, des agents de sécurité pendant la haute saison. (Aides ménagers et agents de nettoyage, manœuvres des mines, du BTP, des industries manufacturières et des transports). 28\n\npostes vacants soit, seulement 100 postes vacants dans les trois gouvernorats (Sidi Bouzid, Kairouan,\n\net Kasserine).

Evaluation des difficultés rencontrées par les entreprises lors du recrutement\n\nUne évaluation des difficultés rencontrées par les entreprises a été effectuée afin de pouvoir\n\nrelever les secteurs et les professions jugés difficiles à pourvoir. Pour ce faire, une note de 1 à 3 a\n\nété attribuée par les chefs des entreprises par profession selon la difficulté de recrutement (1 :\n\nposte très difficile de pourvoir, 2 : Moyennement difficile, 3 : Facile à pourvoir)\n\nAprès un score a été calculé sur la base de ces notes qui sont comprises entre 0 et 1.

        "VI. L’attractivité de l’emploi\n\nPour atteindre une croissance durable et inclusive, la Tunisie a besoin d’entreprises compétitives qui\n\ns’intéressent à offrir des emplois convenables aux employés, surtout avec le changement des types\n\nd’emplois remarquables au cours des dernières décennies. Un intérêt particulier a été accordé à\n\nl’attractivité de l’emploi de la part des chefs d’entreprises. Ces derniers s'intéressent de plus en plus à\n\nce volet. En effet, d’un côté les entreprises cherchent toujours les compétences adéquates à un poste\n\nbien déterminé, et de l’autre côté, les employés cherchent un poste d’emploi attractif. Et plus les\n\ntravailleurs s’il sont motivés et performants, ceci qui va augmenter la productivité des entreprises. 33\n\nC’est dans ce contexte que plusieurs organismes et institutions ont accordé un intérêt particulier à ce\n\nvolet tels que le bureau de Conférence des statisticiens Européen en fournissant un manuel visant à\n\nmesurer la qualité de l’emploi4. Plusieurs autres études ont été publiées dans le même contexte avec des dimensions qui diffèrent\n\nd’une approche à une autre et tout en utilisant des méthodologies différentes, telles que l’étude\n\neffectuée par l’ILO5, par l’OCDE6 et par l’institut national des statistiques au Québec7. La Fondation de Dublin, organe tripartite de l’Union européenne institué en 1975, aussi s’est intéressé\n\nà ce volet qui fait partie de sa mission « contribuer à la conception et à l’établissement de meilleures\n\nconditions de vie et de travail par une action visant à développer et à diffuser les connaissances\n\npermettant de faciliter cette amélioration ». Ainsi, pour cette Fondation, promouvoir « la qualité du\n\ntravail et de l’emploi », c’est tout à la fois « assurer la sécurité de l’emploi et des parcours\n\nprofessionnels, maintenir et promouvoir la santé et le bienêtre des travailleurs, développer les\n\ncompétences et enfin permettre de concilier la vie de travail et la vie hors travail »8. Dans ce contexte, le travail de l’IACE s’est basé sur ces travaux notamment le manuel du bureau de\n\nconférence des Statisticiens Européens afin de choisir les dimensions adéquates qui nous\n\npermettront d’étudier l’attractivité de l’emploi des entreprises interrogées. Le tableau ci-dessous présente les différentes dimensions prises en considération par les organismes\n\nen calculant la qualité de l’emploi, à partir duquel nous nous sommes inspirés pour choisir les différents\n\nvolets à étudier. 4 Handbook on Measuring Quality of Employment a Statistical Framework\n\n5 Working conditions in a global perspective\n\n6 https://www.oecd.org/statistics/job-quality.htm\n\n7 Travail et rémunération, Institut de la Statistique Nationale du Québec\n\n8 Définition et mesure de la qualité de l’emploi : une illustration au prisme des comparaisons européennes, Mathilde Guergoat-Larivière et Olivier Marchand\n\n34\n\nTableau 15 : Correspondances entre les dimensions de la qualité de l’emploi retenues dans les\n\ndifférentes approches internationales9\n\nSource : Définition et mesure de la qualité de l’emploi\n\nConscient de l’importance de ce volet, nous nous sommes intéressés à l’attractivité de\n\nl’emploi, tout en prenant en considération les nouvelles formes d'emploi qui sont en cours\n\nd’être crées. Pour s’aligner aux travaux réalisés à l’échelle internationale, nous avons vérifié la\n\nliste des indicateurs et des dimensions retenues tout en ajustant les sous dimensions selon\n\nle cadre du marché du travail en Tunisie.

Pour pouvoir\n\ncouvrir tous les aspects pertinents, l’enquête nous a permis d’étudier chaque dimension à\n\npart. Il est important de noter que les pourcentages qui seront présentés dans les graphiques par\n\ndimensions sont pondérés par les caractéristiques de chaque entreprise (sa taille, son\n\nsecteur, et sa localisation).

Le choix se justifie par le fait que, par rapport à un taux de chômage national de 15.3% environ,\n\nle taux de diplômés de l’enseignement supérieur est en moyenne de 28.2%. Ce constat explique l’intérêt accordé à cette catégorie de demandeur d’emploi. Il a été\n\ndémontré à maintes occasions que la Tunisie n’a pas de problème dans l’emploi de la main\n\nd’œuvre ordinaire (non qualifiée) mais on enregistre plutôt une pénurie et cela a été même\n\nune question de faire appel à la main d’œuvre étrangère. Nous nous attarderons à ce niveau sur les caractéristiques des diplômés de l’enseignement\n\nsupérieur public et privé. La présente partie porte sur les caractéristiques des diplômés de l’enseignement supérieur,\n\ntous les diplômes confondus. On s’intéressera à l’évolution annuelle de 5 promotions de\n\ndiplômés de l’année universitaire 2011/2012 jusqu’à l’année universitaire 2015/2016 :\n\nPar gouvernorat, - Par type de diplôme, - Et par domaine d’études. L’analyse couvre les années universitaires 2012/13 à 2016/17. I. La formation universitaire : Secteur public\n\nDans cette partie, nous allons commencer par étudier l’évolution du nombre des diplômés\n\npuis dans une deuxième partie présenter les caractéristiques de ces derniers. 41\n\n1. Evolution du nombre des diplômés\n\nEn 2016, le ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieure et de la Recherche Scientifique a délivré\n\n56279 diplômes soit une baisse de 3% par rapport à l’année précédente. L’effectif des diplômés continue ainsi de baisser fortement par rapport à 2012. On enregistre\n\n5253 diplômés de moins, en 2013, 7791 de moins par rapport à 2012. Une diminution de\n\n445 de moins en 2014 par rapport à 2013. En 2017 une baisse de 1644 postes a été\n\nenregistrée par rapport à 2016. Cette tendance baissière s’explique principalement par\n\nl’accroissement du nombre de bacheliers qui choisissent de poursuivre leurs études dans les\n\nuniversités privées.

Répartition des diplômés par gouvernorat\n\nLa légère diminution du nombre de diplômés de l’enseignement supérieur ne se produit pas de\n\nmanière uniforme sur l’ensemble du territoire tunisien. Certains gouvernorats ne sont pas concernés\n\npar la baisse de l’effectif, il s’agit des gouvernorats d’El Kef, Gafsa, Jendouba, Kasserine, Kébili, Mahdia,\n\nMédenine, Monastir, Nabeul, Sfax, Sidi Bouzid, Siliana et Tataouine où le nombre de diplômés a\n\n42\n\naugmenté entre les années 2015- 2016 par rapport aux années 2014-2015.

        "Nous allons commencer par présenter l’échantillon de tous ces\n\ndiplômés interrogés, et dans une deuxième partie nous allons étudier la situation actuelle des\n\ndiplômés à la recherche d’emploi. 1. La description de l’échantillon des diplômés étudiés\n\nL’étude a été menée auprès de 13 500 diplômés de l’enseignement supérieur public et privé. Les\n\ndonnées ont été collectées principalement sur les réseaux sociaux (Facebook, Twitter, etc.). Seulement 26% de ces diplômés déclarent qu’ils ne sont pas inscrits aux bureaux d’emploi. La plupart\n\nde ces diplômés non-inscrits sont âgés entre 18 et 29 ans (89%). Seulement 14,35% des diplômés ont\n\nchoisi de poursuivre leurs études, 38,12% ont trouvé déjà un emploi, 41,37% des diplômés sont\n\ntoujours en chômage, et 6,17% sont toujours des étudiants mais à la recherche d’un emploi. Parmi les diplômés qui travaillent, (38,12%) 60,67% des diplômés qui travaillent opèrent dans leurs\n\ndomaines d’études. 2017\n\n\n\n2,5%\n\n29,4%\n\n18,8%\n\n20,0%\n\n\n\n29,3%\n\n\n\n100,0%\n\n50\n\nFigure 15 : Situation actuelle des diplômés interrogés\n\nPoursuivre leurs études et à la recherche d'emploi; 6,7\n\nPoursuivre leurs études ; 14,35\n\nEmployés; 38,12\n\nDiplômés en chômage; 41,37\n\n Les moyens utilisés pour décrocher le premier poste du travail\n\nSelon les réponses collectées, plus de 1/3 des personnes interrogées déclarent qu’ils décrochent leur\n\npremier poste d’emploi via des parents et amis. Le reste citent d’autres moyens, le graphique ci-\n\ndessous illustre les différents modes de recherches utilisés par les diplômés.

Ce refus peut être expliqué par plusieurs raisons. Mais la rémunération\n\nreste toujours la raison principale (44,7%) vient ensuite l’inadéquation entre le poste et le domaine\n\nd’étude (19%) et finalement la distance par rapport au lieu de résidence (16,4%).

        "51\n\n2. La situation actuelle des diplômés à la recherche d’emploi\n\nDans cette partie, nous allons étudier la situation des diplômés interrogés qui sont actuellement en\n\nchômage. Ainsi quatre axes d’analyses peuvent être développés :\n\n\n\nLe profil des chômeurs ;\n\n\n\nLes raisons de rester en chômage ;\n\n\n\nLes critères de choix d’un emploi.  Le profil des chômeurs interrogés :\n\nComme cité ci-dessus, 41,37% des diplômés interrogés sont des chômeurs répartis comme suit :\n\nTableau 23: Répartition des chômeurs interrogés par âge\n\nTranche d’âge\n\nTaux de chômage (en %)\n\n18-29\n\n81,58%\n\n30-49\n\n18,25%\n\n50 et plus\n\n0,18\n\nSource : Enquête statistique sur l’emploi, IACE (2019)\n\nNous constatons, que ce sont les diplômés âgés entre 18 et 29 ans qui sont les plus touchés par le\n\nchômage selon cette étude. Des mesures correctives devraient être prises en considération pour\n\npouvoir améliorer l’adéquation entre les besoins des entreprises et les diplômes délivrés par les\n\nuniversités.  Les raisons de ne pas trouver un emploi, selon les diplômés :\n\nDans le but d’évaluer leurs perceptions, nous avons demandé à cette catégorie de diplômés d’identifier\n\nles raisons pour lesquelles ils sont toujours en chômage. Les réponses étaient comme suit :\n\n52\n\nTableau 24: Les raisons de rester en chômage selon les diplômés interrogés\n\nRaison\n\nLes répondants (en %)\n\nMarché saturé dans votre domaine de compétence\n\n80,9%\n\nVotre niveau d’étude est insuffisant\n\n7,3%\n\nVous n’avez pas d’accès aux outils de recherche d’emploi\n\n7%\n\nVous êtes surqualifié\n\n4,8%\n\nSource : Enquête statistique sur l’emploi, IACE (2019)\n\n Les critères de choix d’un emploi selon les chômeurs :\n\nPlusieurs critères de choix peuvent influencer la décision de choix d’un emploi ou d’un autre. Le degré\n\nd’importance diffère d’une personne à une autre, c’est dans ce contexte qu’on a demandé aux\n\ndiplômés d’évaluer les critères de choix d’un poste d’emploi selon leurs perceptions. Les conditions de\n\ntravail sont le critère qui est apparu à la tête de la liste. En effet, 65,6% des interrogés déclarent que\n\nles conditions de travail sont importantes voire même très importantes lors de la recherche d’un\n\ntravail. Ceci n’empêche que plusieurs autres critères ont été évalués comme important ou très\n\nimportant tels que présentés dans le tableau ci-dessous :\n\nTableau 25: Les critères de choix d’un poste d’emploi selon les diplômés interrogés\n\nLes Critères\n\n% des réponses (Important ou très\n\nimportant)\n\nConditions de travail (Flexibilité des horaires, Cadre de travail etc.)\n\n65,6%\n\nAvantages sociaux (Assurance, prime etc.)\n\n58 ,8%\n\nDéveloppement des compétences professionnelles (Formation)\n\n58,7%\n\nRémunération\n\n55,7%\n\nEvolution de carrière\n\n51,7%\n\nEntreprise renommée\n\n42%\n\nSource : Enquête statistique sur l’emploi, IACE (2019)\n\nLa rémunération figure aussi à la tête de la liste quand il s’agit des raisons de quitter le poste actuel,\n\nainsi 46,1% des diplômés déclarent pouvoir penser à quitter un poste pour plus de rémunération. Plusieurs autres raisons sont citées comme présenté dans la figure ci-dessous. 53\n\nFigure 17 : La raison pour laquelle les employés peuvent quitter leurs postes actuel\n\nPlus de rémunération\n\n46,10%\n\nConditions de travail plus favorables\n\n18,70%\n\nEvolution de carrière\n\n14,80%\n\nAvantage sociaux\n\n11%\n\nPour une entreprise renommée\n\n4,90%\n\nDéveloppement des compétences professionnelles\n\n4,50%\n\nSource : Enquête statistique sur l’emploi, IACE (2019)\n\n Le lancement d’un projet\n\nDu côté des chômeurs, nous leur avons demandé s’ils ont pensé à monter un projet pour ne pas rester\n\nen chômage, seulement 22% pensent lancer leur propre projet. Plusieurs raisons ont été citées par ceux qui n’ont pas pensé à lancer leur propre projet (78%), comme\n\nprésenté dans le graphique suivant :\n\n58,6%\n\n35,2%\n\n14,9%\n\n12,6%\n\n9,0%\n\n3,0%\n\nPas d’idée de projet\n\nManque de connaissances, compétences et expériences nécessaires\n\nManque de financement\n\nPeur d’échec\n\nManque d’incitations publiques\n\nManque d’informations sur le process\n\nSource : Enquête statistique sur l’emploi, IACE (2019)\n\n54\n\nConclusion\n\nA travers le Rapport National de l’Emploi, l'IACE veut mettre en œuvre un aperçu général\n\nvisant à améliorer la situation de l’emploi en Tunisie. Le rapport comprend une étude sur la\n\nsituation de l'emploi en Tunisie, non seulement du côté de l'offre mais également du côté de\n\nla demande. Un intérêt particulier a été accordé à l’adéquation offre-Demande en calculant\n\nl’indice de l’adéquation :\n\nDu côté de la demande d’emploi, nous avons étudié le processus de recrutement et\n\nles compétences sollicitées par les employeurs. Et la plupart d’entre eux ont déclaré\n\nque les compétences techniques et numériques sont pour eux les plus importantes,\n\nlors de recrutement. Et dans le même contexte, Quarante-sept mille postes ont été déclarés vacants par\n\nles entreprises, la plupart sont issus du secteur de l’industrie. Il est important de noter que plus que la moitié des chefs d’entreprises pensent que la\n\nsituation de l’emploi actuelle va stagner. Ceci peut être expliqué par l’inadéquation\n\nentre le marché de l’offre et de la demande d’emploi en Tunisie, d’où la nécessité de\n\ncalculer l’indice de l’adéquation qui a fait ressortir que seulement 14 gouvernorats ont\n\neu la moyenne au niveau de cet indicateur. Il sera donc essentiel, d’étudier cette inadéquation surtout au niveau de ces\n\ngouvernorats. Du côté de l’offre, les résultats font ressortir que 41,37% des diplômés sont en\n\nchômage, une étude détaillée de la situation de ces chômeurs a été élaborée. En comparant aux éditions précédentes, dans cette édition nous nous sommes attardés sur\n\nl’attractivité de l’emploi."

Explore Pathways to In-Demand Jobs\n\n(In partnership with Workforce Singapore)\n\nIn this edition, the chapter focuses on examining the interplay between five key factors individuals should consider when seeking career opportunities:\n\n1 Wage1 serves as the indicator of value that\n\nemployers place in the job. 2 Demand for jobs refers to the extent to\n\nwhich the job market is seeking to hire for that job role. Understanding the demand for certain jobs can help individuals identify areas where their skills and expertise are sought after, and what some potential career opportunities are. 4 Skills similarity refers to the amount of skills overlap between two jobs. It helps the individuals identify the relevance and transferability of one’s existing skills to different job roles, either within the same sector or across sectors. Recognising similarities between current and desired skills can guide individuals on the effort and feasibility of making a career move. 3 Growth of job roles refers to the trend in\n\nthe demand for the job over the past three years Recognising job roles with positive growth trends can guide individuals towards job roles that have growth prospects and advancement opportunities. 5 Historical transitions across job roles refer to actual movements of workers from one job to the other. Understanding historical transitions can provide insights into the adaptability and resilience of certain career moves, helping individuals make informed decisions2. 52\n\nOn top of these criteria, career development professionals also highlight that individuals can consider past experience, resources required in terms of time and effort, and affordability when making a career move, other than their own values, interest, personality, and skills (VIPS). The five factors are incorporated into a Skills and Job Mobility Dashboard which can be used to explore career pathways that can lead to growth opportunities. The Skills and Job Mobility Dashboard was used to generate the insights for this chapter. Please refer to the Jobs-Skills Portal for the dashboard. 53\n\n146 in-demand job roles with good growth and potential for career mobility were identified based on 2023 job posting data.

A range of career transitions is possible, both into these roles, as well as eventually out to another job role. The purpose of the dashboard is primarily for exploration and analysis only. It is recommended to have conversations with Career Coaches, Skills Ambassadors, or supervisors to further the exploration. There are multiple approaches that individuals can undertake to fulfil their career moves. Job transitions may sometimes require a decrease in salary, depending on the needs of an individual. This situation can arise from various factors such as work-life balance, relocation, personal growth to gain experience in certain fields, job market conditions, and health considerations. It is important to note that while a salary decrease may seem disadvantageous, it can sometimes lead to long-term benefits such as improved job satisfaction, better work-life balance, or enhanced career prospects. 56\n\nLearn to use the Skills and Job Mobility Dashboard, accessible on the Jobs-Skills Portal. 1\n\n2\n\nIdentify your current job role in the ‘Origin Job Role’ drop-down list.

Tracy LEE Assistant Chief Executive (Planning), Workforce Singapore\n\nTo make the best of longer working lives due to increased longevity, one could plan more purposeful career transitions, over the different stages of one’s career16. While some career changes may be driven by one’s immediate financial goals, a purposeful career transition is facilitated by proactive planning and consideration of one’s values, interest, personality, and skills (VIPS), and purpose for a fulfilling career17. Having a career plan also allows one to consider a longer- term view, where a new role might not offer an immediate salary increase but sets the stage for future career changes and growth. To plan one’s career in Singapore, there are self-help digital tools and resources available, such as CareersFinder and Workipedia by MyCareersFuture, as well as personalised career guidance provided by career coaches. Maurice Ng, a Senior Career Coach at WSG, recalled a successful career transition by his client, a software engineer, whose contract was not renewed. He worked with his client to align career goals with his VIPS to shortlist vacancies that resonated with his career goals, and his client took courses in AI to close the skills gap between his previous and new job. Through tailored resume-crafting and intensive interview preparation, Maurice guided his client into a new role in Smart Technology, leading to a 20% wage increase and pivoting into an emerging role with longer-term career growth opportunities. Take a well-planned leap, not into the unknown, but into purposeful career transitions to unlock new opportunities, get closer to your wage aspirations, and open the way to long-term professional growth. 16 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2024. 17 Harvard Business Review, 2023. 61\n\nResearch Insights\n\nPOON King Wang Chief Strategy Officer – SUTD, Director – LKYCIC@SUTD\n\nCandy MAK Yu Shan Researcher – LKYCIC@SUTD\n\nDr Hwang Eujeen Researcher – LKYCIC@SUTD\n\nEunice CHAN Si Wai Researcher – LKYCIC@SUTD\n\nKANG Kok Hua Researcher Volunteer - LKYCIC@SUTD\n\nRadha VINOD Researcher – LKYCIC@SUTD\n\nFlex and flexibility, finding yourself, virtual fitting rooms, and embodied cognition. These are new tools18 designed for successful multiple job transitions, termed Open Loop Careers in a recent research that we completed. The study emphasised that individuals must flex (i.e. demonstrate) their ability to perform in new jobs or roles, instead of claiming they can or have the qualifications. Workers also need to develop flexible work identities, identifying with their next position during career transitions. What’s Next GPT: Uses GenAI to map creative options to the whole-of-person i.e. work, life, and wellbeing\n\nThese tools engage multiple senses to engender earlier change, because when we “set the body in motion, the brain follows”20. They adopt the cognitive science view of “embodied cognition” where brain, body, and environment are engaged in thinking and decision-making, unlike the conventional focus on the brain as a computer where change happens by “installing instructions”. Both flex and flexibility are challenging. To address this, we designed localised tools to engender earlier change and smoother transitions. These tools also enhance other resources such as the Employability Self-Assessment for Older Adults, which reveals areas where flex and flexibility in work are enhanced. To exercise flexibility, we designed tools to find yourself: • Career Quest Cards19: A gamified, fun and tactile self- discovery/assessment of trade-offs to clarify priorities • Career Journey Maps: A tactile, visual, active reflection similar to reminiscence therapy and functional medicine\n\nMoreover, when stacked in sequence — where the output of one tool becomes the input for another — individuals feel a sense of progress, further engendering change. This approach increases the likelihood of successfully making multiple transitions. To exercise flexing, we built virtual fitting rooms that include: • Skills Swap: A role-playing game to expand work options to the unfamiliar or unusual, yet plausible. 18 Singapore University for Technology and Design, 2024."

Tagging job posting data (2019-2023) to Singapore\n\nStandard Occupational Classification (SSOC) Job posting data was tagged to the SSOC 2020, and at SSOC level 5, which focuses on the job role level. This granular classification allows for a clear distinction between different job roles, providing deeper insights into job demand and specific skill requirements. B. Tagging job posting data (2019-2023) to a more refined\n\nskill clustering In the previous edition of the SDFE report, skills extracted from job posting data were classified into the Singapore Skills Taxonomy (SST) level 1 which has 10 clusters, with the inclusion of Apps & Tools to make a total of 11 clusters. C. Tagging Applications and Tools to job posting data (2019-\n\n2023) To keep pace with evolving needs, SSG has expanded its database to encompass over 5,000 unique Apps & Tools. In this report, Apps & Tools were mapped to work functions via job roles. Since each job role was mapped to one work function and each item in the list of Apps & Tools can be mapped to more than one job role, each item in the list of Apps & Tools can be mapped to more than one work function. To derive the proportion of Apps & Tools used by respective work functions, the total count of Apps & Tools belonging to the work function was divided by the total count of Apps & Tools in 2023. In this edition, a data-driven approach was taken to refine the clustering of skills to six clusters based on broad business functions and critical core skills, reflecting the skill requirements needed across job roles in the Singapore economy. The six skill clusters are: Business and Financial Management, Critical Core Skills, Engineering and Manufacturing, Information Technology and Data Management, Operational Excellence, and Organisational and People Management. The 24 Apps & Tools clusters based on work functions are: Accounting, Administrative, Arts and Design, Business Development, Community and Social Services, Consulting, Customer Success and Support, Education, Engineering, Finance, Healthcare Services, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Marketing, Media and Communication, Military and Protective Services, Operations, Program and Project Management, Purchasing, Quality Assurance, Real Estate, Research, and Sales. For an additional layer of analysis, Apps & Tools were also categorised as AI-related if they contributed to the creation, development, or deployment of AI, leverage AI capabilities, or are associated with AI in general. 71\n\nAnalysis methodologies applied in Chapter 1: Changes in Requirements of Job Roles\n\nD. Performing data analysis for Skills\n\nIn a given year, to derive the demand of a skill cluster, the total count of skills within each skill cluster was divided by the total count of skills across all 6 skill clusters based on job postings in a year and was presented as a percentage. This methodology can be applied at two levels: the job role level, which reveals the relative importance of different skill clusters within specific job roles, and the economy level, which illustrates the distribution of skill cluster demand across the entire Singapore economy. Demand of skills in a skill cluster\n\n=\n\nTotal count of skills for a given cluster in a year\n\nTotal count of skills in a year\n\n100\n\nThe same calculation for demand was done for AI-related Apps & Tools.

This refers to the top 10 mentioned Apps and Tools based on the number of their mentions in job postings for that particular job role. F. Measurement of job demand and change of job demand\n\nIn this chapter, data from five years (2019-2023) was analysed to provide a time-series view of the skills requirement for job roles. Additional analysis focused on the top 10 in-demand skills within each job role’s three most in-demand skill clusters were also included. Job demand was derived by dividing the number of job posting of a given job role in year, by the total number of job posting in the same year and presented as a percentage.

Performing data analysis for Apps & Tools via work\n\nfunctions In a given year, to derive the demand of Apps & Tools used by a work function, the total count of Apps & Tools tagged to a work function was divided by the total count of Apps & Tools and presented as a percentage. Change of job demand was derived by using Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) based on job postings from 2020 to 2023. This resulted in a percentage that reflected the growth in employers’ demand for the job compounded over four calendar years.

Definition of Priority Skills\n\nPriority skills are a basket of skills that are deemed as currently in-demand, seeing positive growth or demanded by more than one unique job role. These skills were derived from SSG’s National Jobs-Skills Intelligence engine and validated with expert input from industry, academia and sector agencies. In the various charts within this chapter, SSG chose to spotlight skills whose demand grew in recent years, rather than just skills with a large, existing demand. The spotlighted skills were more likely to see shortages in the present and near future. B Measurement of Demand and Transferability of a Skill\n\nThe demand of a skill represents the proportion of a given priority skill within the total number of skills listed in the economy group. The formula was derived as:\n\nC. Defining Skills Forecasting\n\nSkills Forecasting refers to the predicted demand and transferability for 2025 generated by a machine-learning model. The machine-learning model for Skills Forecasting was trained with historical demand data or transferability and employed Linear Regression to predict the value of all skills for the year 2025. The model used a sliding window approach, incorporating the average demand or transferability of each skill over a three-month window, extending up to two years on a monthly basis, thus creating a total of 24 windows as predictors. Additionally, the model took in the embedding of each skill title using Word2Vec, which were also used as part of the set of predictors. Demand of skill\n\n=\n\nCount of job posting for a given priority skill in year\n\nCount of job posting for all priority skills in year\n\n100\n\nTransferability of a skill refers to the number of unique job roles that require the skill in that year. In this segment, transferability was calculated year by year based on job postings from 2022- 2024 and for 2025 using the Skills Forecasting methodology. The formula was derived as:\n\nn\n\nTransferability of Skill =\n\n∑\n\nUnique SSOC that required this skill (year)\n\nD. Understanding the Skills Matrix\n\nPriority skills were plotted on a scatter plot with their demand as the vertical axis and transferability (i.e. number of unique job roles requiring that skill) as the horizontal axis for each given year. Then, the priority skills were categorised using the 70th percentile mark as a benchmark for both axes, resulting in four quadrants of skills: In-demand quadrant, Up-and-coming quadrant, Niche quadrant, and Transferable quadrant. A given priority skill can be plotted on the Skills Matrix for a given year, into one of the four quadrants. Repeating this for a number of consecutive years, the position of the skill on the Skills Matrix may change, resulting in the skill movement being observed across years. i=1\n\n73\n\nAnalysis methodologies applied in Chapter 3: Creative Industries Skills Spotlight\n\nA. Scoping of Creative professionals\n\nCreative professionals include job roles whose primary responsibilities involve creative work such as art, design, media, marketing, and event management. They may be working in companies whose core business is in creative fields or creative departments within businesses in other industries. A total of 71 creative job roles, at SSOC level 5 were identified, of which job posting data of 45 creative job roles were available for analysis. B. Performing data analysis of Skills\n\nFor analysis on Apps & Tools used by non-Creative professionals, job posting data of non-Creative SSOCs were used, and those performing work relating to art, design, marketing, and media and communications were further examined. D. Performing data analysis on transferability of creative skills Creative skills were identified based on skills specific to sectors in Design, Media, Built Environment (Architect) and Tourism (content and experience creation) as well as skills that were tagged to creative job roles relating to Marketing, Branding, Public Relations, Attraction and Event Management. Based on the job posting data of creative job roles, the demand of a skill cluster was derived by dividing the total count of skills within each cluster from job postings each year, by the total count of skills across all six clusters based on job postings for the same year. The transferability of creative skills was based on the methodology used in Chapter 2. E. Poll on Creative professionals’ perception of GenAI to their\n\nData from five years (2019-2023) was analysed to provide a time-series view of the job market, comparing skills and economic trends. work The poll was conducted to capture the general sentiments of Creative professionals on the use of GenAI at work, perceived benefits, potential applications and considerations integrating into work. C. Performing data analysis for Apps & Tools via work functions The computation of the Apps & Tools was based on the methodology used in Chapter 1. For analysis on Apps & Tools used by Creative professionals, only job posting data of Creative professionals were used. It was administered online from 24 Jul to 17 Sep 2024 by inviting Creative professionals through various channels including LinkedIn and professional communities. A total of 104 responses were collected, of which 87 indicated that they were professionals from Arts, Marketing and Media, and their responses were tabulated accordingly. 74\n\nAnalysis methodologies applied in Chapter 4: Explore Pathways to In-Demand Jobs (In partnership with Workforce Singapore)\n\nA.

Identification of potential career pathways for roles\n\nsuitable for career transition Career pathways comprise of the original role (i.e. the user’s current job role), followed by a first destination role, and a second destination role. The first destination role is a role identified to be potentially suitable role for career transition as mentioned in (A) on page 75. These pathways were identified using SSG developed proprietary knowledge graph1 connecting data on jobs, skills and training courses. Job transitions were identified based on the following criteria:\n\na) Job roles with many skills in common: This was measured in two ways, and in both cases greater importance was placed on skills that were considered more “unique”2 to a job role:\n\nJaccard similarity). This ratio determined the ranking of the adjacent job roles that an original role can transition into.

Introduction\n\n1.1."

    [
        "Background and Significance\n\nThe field of electrical engineering is inescapably intertwined with society’s almost universal reliance on electrical and electronic devices. What has been called a technology gap exists between capabilities created by electrical engineering innovation and applications that are socially supported by this engineering capability. This holds special significance for institutions that either directly or indirectly fund research or take it to the market. Technology initiatives may rise to address innovations and problems in the electrical engineering field, but not without the assistance of competent electrical engineers. In educating future practitioners to address the challenges of scale, complexity, and reliability, employers have found a solution in government-funded apprenticeships. Government apprenticeship schemes directly address many applications for electrical engineering innovation and findings in schools. However, prospective practitioners arrive with a pre-admissions view of this awkwardly varied field, dauntingly vast in content alone. A prospective civil engineer may live with a mental model of their future role that involves building bridges, but students attracted to electrical engineering have no such concrete image. Unprepared for their initial tasks, they have the highest dropout rate of all engineering disciplines. The colleges and departments of engineering most heavily involved in knowledge transfer also have the highest average dropout rates. But the problem need not exist."

        "By now, most schools feel that they have figured it out enough to give an account of their approach. Within these approaches, flexibility is often noted. While they may be in a different context, schools of engineering and sciences, some of the solutions suggest ways forward for all institutions involved in initiatives to address the technology gap. The purpose is to account for a variety of institutional responses to the technology gap and the challenges of scale, complexity, and reliability, focus on how the output of this research has found its way back to schools, and describe initiatives that have arisen from this interaction. Such initiatives are proposed as an important element in evaluating research that is socially viable and subject to wider acute awareness, public debate, and concern, a need exacerbated by the eagerness of the electrical engineering industry to exploit the capacity for positive social or environmental change. Electrical engineering has a key role in the development of safety and performance standards, commonly a significant barrier to entry or acceptance of new technologies, and on the ethics of inherent or attachable risks. 1.1. Background and Significance\n\nIn recent decades, rapid advances in electrical engineering have led to numerous innovations, enabling the incorporation of new technologies into both consumer and industrial settings. The 21st century has witnessed notably swift advancements in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, blockchain, quantum computing, and renewable energy. Meanwhile, innovations in traditional talents cultivated by educational and training systems have fallen behind. As a consequence, employers are now severely hampered by shortages of trained\n\npractitioners to support the commercialization and maintenance of innovations, and the upskilling or reskilling of further cohorts of trained practitioners. In particular, the electrical engineering profession has faced challenges associated with recent innovations, in addition to the problems common across other engineering professions, caused primarily by rapid technical changes. (Pennisi, 2022)\n\nThe anticipated effects of rapid advances on the workforce in the engineering professions include widening skill gaps across individual organizations, firms, and sectors; greater workforce churn and job dissolution; the creation of entirely novel roles; and the tendency for employment growth to initially be concentrated in metropolitan areas, facilitating the movement of individuals across jobs, organizations, and sectors, but subsequently becoming more diffusely spread over all areas as workplaces, roles, and skills mature. Additionally, the passage of time is likely to result in expectations of heightening constraints on the ability of educational and training systems to effectively meet the expectations of the workforce. Government-operated apprenticeships in electrical engineering align with workforce expectations and are pivotal for the emergence of practical solutions that address the competition experienced by other educational and training systems. (Ximenes & Araujo2022)\n\nThe practice of government-operated apprenticeships is established in various countries, where all participating employers, regardless of field, size, or location, are granted monetary support. Over decades, employer cohorts have become self-organizing, collaboratively determining education and training parameters and obligations. This approach allows innovative modifications to remain responsive to emerging challenges, without government intervention. Meanwhile, employers have limited influence over the coarser, one-size-fits-all standards enforced on all firms, providers, and industries by the national educational and training systems, which oversee and sanction up to an entire cohort's participation. Such systems often struggle to remain responsive to changes unfolding at a rapid pace, such as in electrical engineering. (Ximenes & Araujo2022)(Zoellner2022)\n\n1.2. Purpose and Scope\n\nThe primary aim of this essay is to explore the challenges arising from advancements in electrical engineering technologies on a global scale and to discuss how government apprenticeships in such fields can be utilized in Norway and elsewhere. A myriad of developments, including positive changes such as sustainable energy generation and storage, as well as concerns regarding hacking, privacy invasion, and regional conflicts due to sophisticated armaments, are anticipated. An emphasis on how engineering education can adjust to the dynamically evolving scenario is paramount. (Smith, 2023)\n\nIn Norway, discussions on educational reforms face restrictions in scope and timing. Consequently, the active participation of electrical engineering departments in universities may fall behind in innovation and public concern. Crafting a well-considered plan for government apprenticeships to swiftly shift the focus and contents of electrical engineering education is essential. Such a plan would guarantee the capability of effectively processing both impending challenges and beneficial developments. Furthermore, it is justifiable to demand financing for such actions, as they would not only benefit Norway but also contribute positively to global issues, hence bringing economic advantages to the country in the long run. The composition of the plan is generally applicable to any country. However, it has been tailored to apply primarily to Norway, where no similarly comprehensive action plan has been considered previously. The essay begins with an overview of recent developments in electrical engineering and anticipated advances, changing the educational requirements on society and electrical engineering university education. The second part discusses government apprenticeships to meet the new requirements, aiming at ensuring that electrical engineers can understand and work with power, constructs, hardware and software, and infrastructures at all relevant levels. Potential topics for government apprenticeships are listed to ensure the coherence, proactivity, versatility, and impact of the education on society. The essay concludes with a summary of the plan."

Foundations of Electrical Engineering\n\nThe foundations of electrical engineering are intertwined with the origins of electricity, electrical machines, and electronics. Concise treatment is given to each of these subjects and the resulting subdivisions of electrical engineering. Historical milestones are emphasized to equate the disciplines with the community’s awareness of the exploitations made upon the underlying phenomena. The vast scale of electronics asks for some explanation of its own consequences for the profession. Electrical engineering is largely concerned with the phenomena associated with electricity. Hence, it would not be unreasonable to start building its foundations from electricity itself. However, historical awareness of electricity is scant, and its modeling under classical electrostatics is quite recent, having started only during the second half of the 18th century. There was awareness of action-at-a-distance between electrified bodies long before this modeling, but this was vague somehow. The mathematical treatment that followed did bring clarity, so it starts from there."

        "It was taken to Europe from the U.S. by Franklin in 1759. The potential spread, in turn, inspired the invention of the Leyden jar in 1745. (Deckelman, 2024)\n\nMuch practical knowledge resulted from this theoretical treatment. From the many discoveries, two were of paramount importance, namely, the possibility of generating electricity mechanically by rubbing glass and amber, and the possibility of generating electricity also chemically. The latter discovery gave birth to the batteries of Volta, which constituted an abundant source of low-voltage electricity. The discharge of a Leyden jar supplied high-voltage electricity, which provoked great social interest and curiosity. There were also many attempts to apply electricity for possible telecommunication. The first successful one was performed in 1800 in Copenhagen, seven years after the discovery of the law of force. 2.1. Historical Overview\n\nThe foundations of electrical engineering consist of the scientific and technological substructures of the discipline. The history of electrical engineering reveals technological advancements or major innovations that established the substructures. The evolution of electrical engineering from its protohistoric forms in the late eighteenth century to 2019 is sketched based on a compilation of the historical developments, scientific theories, and innovative technologies during this interval. (Marques et al.2022)\n\nThis historical overview is based on the compilation of the milestones, achievements, innovations, discoveries, inventions, and technological advancements in electrical engineering from its beginning to modern times. It addresses the major technical breakthroughs or events associated with electrical engineering development. The main focus is on electrical technological innovation, while historical inventions that did not involve technological advancement are excluded. (Khan et al.2020)\n\nThe historical milestones are classified into 11 groups corresponding to the fundamental electrical engineering disciplines or subfields. To assist interested researchers and practitioners who wish to review the state-of-the-art technological innovations, there is a detailed exposition of the milestones, including innovative technologies and applications, the contributed scientific theories, and the renowned researchers and engineers with their achievements. Within the scope of electrical engineering, a broad range of applications, devices, and systems that wield electricity and/or elicit electrical phenomena are accommodated. The coverage of the foundational developments of electrical engineering is broader than previous historical investigations. A thorough examination of the past electrical technological innovations and advancements with regard to electrical engineering disciplines reveals the technical origin and historic development of the discipline. The understanding of the foundations of electrical engineering in advanced and developing societies is beneficial for national planning programs in science and technology, donations of funds or effort in research and education programs in electrical engineering or related fields, and allocation of industrial investments and development. The past electrical technological advancements and innovations that have yielded electrical engineering disciplines are not only of historical interest but also provide insight and caution for anticipating the future of electrical engineering. (Rahimullah et al.2020)\n\n2.2. Key Concepts and Principles\n\nThe field of electrical engineering encompasses a rich tapestry of concepts, principles, and theories critical for inventing, designing, and developing electrical and electronic systems and devices. Electric charge, a central concept, underpins electromagnetism, with static charge giving rise to electric fields and forces. Current, the flow of charges, powers many electrical and electronic circuits, while potential difference drives charge movement. Ohm's law, a foundational principle, relates voltage, current, and resistance in electrical components, particularly resistors. (Arora & Mosch, 2022)\n\nMagnetic fields arise from electric currents and exert forces on charges, leading to devices like motors and generators. Inductance describes how changing currents induce voltages, a principle harnessed in transformers and energy storage. Various components, including conductors, resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits, form electrical circuits and systems. Voltage sources supply energy, while signal sources produce AC or digital signals for processing or transmission. Circuit analysis techniques, such as nodal analysis and theorems, help determine circuit behavior. Linear circuit theory analyzes circuits where voltages and currents are related linearly, while frequency domain analysis studies circuits' behavior concerning sinusoidal signals. (Boyer, 2023)\n\nCircuit synthesis designs circuits to meet specifications, may be passive without active elements, require creative knowledge of component principles and values, and can be challenging. Circuit theorems help analyze complex networks, and electrical signals convey information—continuous-time signals change over time; discrete-time signals vary at distinct moments, complicating communication or processing. Random signals are unpredictable with statistical analysis. (Schmitt et al.2021)\n\nTime-domain analysis studies signal evolution over time using the impulse response. Its Fourier transform converts signals to the frequency domain, representing them as sinusoids at various frequencies, simplifying circuit analysis or designing filters to store or modify specific frequency components. Modern electrical engineering also embraces systems theory and signal processing, defining systems that transform signals, decomposing them into simpler or modifying components. 3. Innovations in Electrical Engineering\n\nThe field of electrical engineering has always been, and will continue to be, at the forefront of technical innovation. However, engineers must be prepared to meet new challenges, including an increasing diversity of disciplines and a requirement for lifelong learning. Graduates of electrical engineering programs must be trained not only in technical content, but also in the capacity to adapt to and help guide that changing environment. Technical innovation requires creativity, and creative thinking techniques must be an integral part of the education. Continuing education programs must also be implemented that are appropriately designed to stimulate creativity in both individuals and corporate environments. Educational procedures such as lab modernization and a corporate partnership program directed at both students and faculty, which address many of the difficulties confronting future electrical engineers, are discussed. Emerging Technologies\n\nElectrical engineering has always been, and continues to be, a profession of rapid technological advancement in all fields. There is no reason to believe that the pace of change will slow anytime soon. For example, in just the last few years, and continuing now in the proposed systems: 1. Analog and RF are gone from most ICs, replaced by digital. 2. Smartphones arrived and became the dominant platform, replacing everything from PCs to game consoles. 3. Everything is now competing with everything else; computers compete with TVs and radios compete with calculators. 4. A new generation of students who mostly only use the products, and do not understand how they work. 5. Product designs requiring cuts in staff and cycles. 6. A new wave of outsourcing designs, and jobs fleeing the United States. 7. Going green and limited resources, particularly for electrical engineers. The future: It will no longer be possible for electrical engineers to know everything there is to know about a given discipline. They will have to rely on outsiders to some extent. It may become impossible for one person to design what is now done by a team of engineers. The number of people in a design cycle will be roughly constant, but these engineers will be from entirely different disciplines than just electrical. Engineers must know who to listen to or how to prioritize the advice received to achieve the final product. Smart Grids and Renewable Energy Integration\n\nA smart grid is an electricity supply network that uses digital communication technology to detect and react to local changes in usage. It has been hailed as the electricity network of the future and has a broad range of applications that can be divided into smart transmission networks, smart distribution networks, power utilization, production and storage, and electric vehicles. In a smart grid, monitors, automation, and control equipment enable two-way communication between the control and the field, and systems used to view and model power systems utilize that information to make better operational and planning decisions. The so- called “smart meters” allow the utility to view usage and outages and charge the consumer for power used, the voltage, their power factor, and other parameters. With the advent of digital electronic devices, telemetry, telecontrol, and advanced distribution automation became possible with two-way communication. Power monitoring systems were put in place to detect abnormalities, and transmission and generation systems were put online to respond to them automatically. In transmission systems, Automatic Generation Control was implemented in the mid-1960s. In the early 1990s, due to a number of factors, including advanced technology at relay companies, urgings by regulators, and requirements for advanced automation, competitive multinational utilities, and local utilities needed to progress toward more advanced control. (Dileep, 2020)\n\n3.1. Emerging Technologies\n\nNew technological advancements are significantly transforming the electrical engineering field, presenting both opportunities and challenges for the industry. A focus on five emerging technologies is vital to address these challenges. Technologies in microgrids, energy management systems, demand response, renewable and energy-efficient buildings, and smart electric vehicles are essential. Microgrids and other distributed generation systems, especially with rooftop solar photovoltaics, are emerging as viable electricity systems in the present utility grid paradigm. They can operate in both grid-connected and islanded modes, providing resilience against unexpected outages and potential cost savings. Electrical power systems, with many interconnected components, are susceptible to cascading failures that can ultimately disconnect the entire network and entail serious catastrophic consequences. Since the failure of a small number of components is often the reason behind such large-scale disturbances, monitoring their dynamic state and preventing cascading failures through advanced control algorithms are major research challenges. The fault detection, identification, and recovery research provide players of the smart grid with better tools for online network state monitoring and control. (Liu et al.2020)\n\nAlthough certain systems have been used in the past in various applications, the integration of energy-efficient LED lighting systems into these systems, which has never been implemented before, shows great potential. Control and communication protocols were tested to establish the feasibility of this integration without requiring significant infrastructure or hardware changes for existing systems. The proposed architecture is flexible, easy to adapt to different types of lighting and control devices, and provides various options for visualization, comprehensive monitoring, and access. Intelligent energy management schemes in a renewable energy-battery household can smartly integrate various demand and supply side resources, including outdoor and indoor appliances. As part of the planned activities, proposed management algorithms will be implemented and experimentally validated on a small-scale renewable energy-battery coupled laboratory setup. Control architectures for actuator and load predictive future states will be developed as well as benchmarking and validation of their performance. The design and implementation of Energy Management Systems will be used to validate their solution on the experimental setup, potentially with low optimization run-time but a robust optimization solution."

        "3.2. Smart Grids and Renewable Energy Integration\n\nThe integration of renewable energy sources into existing electrical grids presents a multitude of challenges that require innovative solutions. One promising technology is the development of smart grids, which utilize advanced sensors, communication networks, and data analytics to enable more efficient and reliable management of electricity distribution. The implementation of smart grids creates a need for experts skilled in both electrical engineering and data analysis. When a growing number of renewable energy resources are integrated into the existing electrical grid, new challenges arise concerning electricity distribution management. Various renewable energy sources, such as wind power, water power, and electricity from solar cells, are usually combined through a simple electricity distribution network. However, the variations in strength for renewable energy resources and electricity consumption at different network nodes create a complex management challenge. For instance, wind power is strong on some days but very poor on others, while electricity consumption at factories increases strongly when businesses are starting up in the morning but drops when they are closing. (Sinsel et al., 2020)\n\nOne innovative solution to this problem is to first figure out how much energy will be produced by the different renewable energy sources at future time slots. This can be achieved by statistical analysis, as each energy resource has its own variation strengths. Time series can be described with different models based on the predicted time interval. For example, ARMA models can be used for short time intervals, while ARIMA models can be used for long time intervals. It will also be important to determine how much electricity will be consumed by factories and cities. For these time series, RegARIMA models could be appropriate. A calculation model will be generated, and based on statistical time series analysis, adjusted predictions of how much energy will be produced or consumed will be made. Once the calculations of the produced and consumed energy have been made, it will be important to determine whether it is economically reasonable to use storage. Storage will be reasonable only when it is cheaper than buying electricity from the electricity stock exchange. For this purpose, the spot price for radially connected electricity networks has to be calculated. The spot price calculation procedure is very complex and requires many calculations for different price scenarios, which means that some approximation methods will have to be applied. Artificial intelligence techniques, such as neural networks, can be used to achieve cheaper calculations for the spot price determination. 4. Challenges and Opportunities\n\nThe rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, and other digital technologies has brought opportunities to develop new products and business models for many sectors,\n\nincluding electrical engineering. However, with each opportunity comes challenges that need to be proactively addressed. These challenges range from risks that fall under national security or corporate strategy, which are typically addressed internally, to issues that evolve and can only be dealt with through collaboration. The latter concerns problems with societal impacts, which are typically dealt with through regulations. Groups such as governments, NGOs, and research communities can play a role in ensuring problems are optimally addressed through collaborations with industry. Security is a primary concern in the development of fewer IoT devices. Historically, electrical engineers needed to comprehend both hardware and software aspects of a system accurately. The growing and evolving risks stemming from connected devices, platforms, and the cloud is a field where regulators are still working to understand the scope and effects. Countries differ widely in their approaches, and harmonization efforts have only been started. Most corporate guidelines are still focused on core problems with known solutions and limited effectiveness outside large organizations. (Brass & Sowell, 2021)\n\nPrivacy is an emerging and contested societal problem. Although largely manageable in wired systems, the combination of vast amounts of personal data and machine learning is leading to unforeseen consequences. Considerable research is still needed to understand the scope and consequences. Governments can help by identifying and establishing harmonized boundaries and frameworks based on social viability, legality, and ethics. An explicit framework for ethical machine learning is needed, delineating what is scientifically possible from what is considered ethical and acceptable. Society is facing an unprecedented need for energy-efficient and resource-efficient technologies, both to curb climate change and to cope with the rising need for raw materials."

        "The electrical sector is expected to play a major role in this endeavor. The wholesale electrification of society, where energy transport is becoming fully electrified, is anticipated to play a role similar to the democratization of energy transport that took place with the introduction of the local electricity grid and its democratized participatory structures. Here, electrical engineers have the opportunity to research and develop wholesale electricity grid solutions globally. 4.1. Cybersecurity Threats\n\nThe rapid advancement of technologies such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things has led to an expansion of the cyber domain and an escalation of attacks on critical infrastructure, local businesses, and public and private organizations. Recent events in the geopolitical arena have only increased the likelihood of cyber damage. These developments have provoked a public response, including investing in offensive capabilities, building active defense capabilities, and investing in detection and prevention technologies. Cyberspace defenders are working with regional and national militaries, and there is an ability to undertake attacks to inflict damage and destruction. On the industry side, there has been investment in upcoming technologies that could be used to inflict such damage, including drone swarms, autonomous vehicles, and artificial intelligence in offense. (Djenna et al., 2021)\n\nWhile a plethora of investment, ideas, technologies, strategies, solutions, nations, and entities should provide protection, it is always possible to forget something and rely too much on\n\nwhat exists. The paranoia regarding offensive capabilities should hopefully be accompanied by an equal or greater effort to protect defense capabilities. Overall, these gaps will be covered by offensive systems with increased investments across the West to counter the perceived threat. As technologies develop and expand into critical infrastructure, utilities, and other sensitive entities, concepts such as attack trees, the introduction of weaponized technologies, and automated systems that could build damage scenarios, operation plans, and even the approach, entry, and escape scenarios need to be considered. Still, someone must worry about the defense. Nations have invested heavily in defining potential scenarios and attempting to keep the adventure at a simulation level and in a virtual domain. 4.2. Sustainability and Environmental Concerns\n\nThe growing concern about climate change and the need to reduce carbon emissions is facing challenges in many industries, including electrical engineering. It is crucial to find new, renewable, and sustainable resources, products, and systems of energy generation and use. Special care should be taken in innovative designs of electrical devices like motors, transformers, circuit breakers, power supplies, etc., to avoid huge losses of energy in the form of heat. Sustainable solutions must be found in the development, production, use, and recycling of electrical materials. Efforts are ongoing to remove the hazardous heavy metal lead from lead-based electrical materials. New structural, functional, and smart electrical materials and devices based on biocompatible and biodegradable bio-organic substances are being searched for. Innovative and smart materials for electrical engineering applications are being investigated, including polyaniline-silica and polyaniline-montmorillonite composites, silk sericin biopolymer/cellulose benzylated composites, and silicone resin/cellulose composites. The emergence of new power generation technologies, like thermophotovoltaic, triboelectric nanogenerators, and electrowettability-based microfluidic generators, and new construction materials/devices for energy tree harvesting challenges traditional ideas and knowledge on the subject. Transportation technologies are being investigated to avoid road congestion by considering new systems of passenger air transportation based on eVTOL vehicles. Because most of these challenges need serious issues to be addressed in electrical engineering education, government-funded educational programs and apprenticeships should be organized and implemented for engineering and non-engineering graduates. (Musa)\n\n5. Government Apprenticeships in Electrical Engineering\n\n5.1. Overview of Apprenticeship Programs Amidst a backdrop of evolving job opportunities arising from innovations, a volatile economic and academic climate, and rising unemployment rates, students face critical decisions in deciding on their educational path after secondary school. Attending university, technical college, and so forth. Services rise has inspired focus on developing and fostering partnerships between higher education and local businesses. The businesses’ perspective on education has fluctuated, moving from focusing solely on what colleges and universities should deliver to focusing on building awareness of what businesses can offer schools and students. Moreover, the question arises whether these partnerships directly benefit student preparation for the workforce. Nevertheless, two school- business partnership programs address the educational and professional needs of the institutions as well as the needs of students entering the job market. Both programs foster\n\nbusiness-school partnerships where higher education providers occupy the roles, while local businesses fill the role of value-added, co-op service partners. (Jones et al.2021)\n\nGovernment apprenticeships in electrical engineering are available in many countries, with each administration operating through a different agency. In state-funded federally approved apprenticeship programs, allowable expenses are established by the relevant authorities. Basic items of subsidized expense are: salary to apprentice, salary to trainer, and establishment of training facilities. An establishment must pay the apprentice an average of no less than $2.00 per hour for the first eleven months of training. The employer is required to keep records of the apprenticeship training program, display posters pertaining to the apprenticeship program, and maintain a complaint procedure. A complete outline of responsibilities of both employer and apprentice is included in the table of contents. A clock- hour training schedule for the electrical worker apprenticeship program is included as required by the apprenticeship agreement. The training schedule provides for a total of 2000 hours of planned training and sets forth acceptable programs for on-the-job training. The detailed outline for on-the-job training is included in the text. 5.2. Benefits and Impact Occupational safety and health guidelines for the training program are also complete and include an outline of safety training topics. A detailed outline of the written-test evaluation program to be employed in the apprenticeship training program is included. The written tests are intended to be formative and summative in purpose and range from ten to twenty questions, using all types of evaluation formats. Measures to evaluate the training program based on written tests and record-keeping of trainer observations are described. The establishment’s policies concerning discrimination against women, minorities, and handicapped applicants are stated as required in the apprenticeship standards. A formal grievance procedure is outlined to ensure that all complaints are properly evaluated and resolved. Commitment of resources is described, as non-federal assets will exceed the federally funded portion of the apprenticeship program by five times. Finally, past experience with other programs funded by relevant authorities is cited as evidence of the establishment’s ability to successfully administer government-funded programs. 5.1. Overview of Apprenticeship Programs\n\nApprenticeship programs are training systems where individuals, referred to as apprentices, work under the guidance of experienced professionals or mentors. Initiated during the Middle Ages for various skilled trades, the concept of apprenticeship has persisted, adapting to meet the needs of modern societies. In recent times, it has gained renewed attention as many countries struggle to ensure that young generations acquire marketable skills. In many developed countries, electrical engineers often begin their professional careers as apprentices. This transition involves the completion of an academic education, followed by entering the apprenticeship program of an electrical utility company. Many of these companies have established in-house training systems designed for this purpose, ensuring that the new employees meet the organization's needs and can efficiently work in operational jobs involving electrical equipment. Developing countries are now beginning to introduce similar systems. In Europe, extensive job-specific training systems have been in place for almost a century. These systems are part of the education system and provide a strong basis for better preparing the workforce to meet the needs of the labor market. The most essential aim of an apprenticeship program is to help the apprentice progress from a novice or beginner to a qualified person in terms of knowledge, skills, and competencies related to the working job. However, defining the starting point and the expected role in this process is not trivial. Assessing the entry level in terms of knowledge, skills, and competencies is usually difficult, while the learning contents and expected level after an apprenticeship are often not explicitly stated. Apprenticeship programs can vary significantly across organizations and countries. There are fewer similarities than expected, and these differences often relate not only to the training approaches adopted but also to the industrial and organizational cultures and the business context of the establishments where the apprenticeship takes place. 5.2. Benefits and Impact\n\nUnderstanding the social, economic, and environmental benefits of apprenticeships—in particular, government-sponsored apprenticeships—has become a focus for researchers and policymakers as countries around the world work to address skills shortages and meet future labor market developments. Several benefits arise from government apprenticeships for companies, apprentices, education and training suppliers, and society as a whole. The creation of a systematic monitoring project would provide information on the impact of government-sponsored apprenticeship programs. Specifically, research needs to address questions such as whether these apprenticeships offer sufficient training, whether this training reflects the needs of companies, and how government policies may influence the extent to which governments carry out company training. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have generally undersupplied apprentices, and the underperformance is most extreme in the case of lower-end apprenticeships. In other sectors and groups, initial vocational training was found to predominantly take place outside the workplace, causing concern regarding the relevance and quality of this type of training. A range of initiatives aimed at enhancing apprenticeship opportunities, company involvement in training, and motivation to train, especially in low- and medium-skilled jobs, is being implemented. The main understanding of the social, economic, and environmental benefits of apprenticeships should include information on who supplies these benefits and how. Current assessment criteria should be extended to include the wider social, economic, and environmental benefits of apprenticeships. A cost-benefit analysis approach should be considered. Assessment of government initiatives, in the form of a review of ten recently implemented policies aimed at promoting apprenticeships and company training, should be included. While there is a general understanding that apprenticeships support a number of social, economic, and environmental benefits, there is a lack of rigorous empirical evidence to support this understanding. Consequently, there is a need for research that evidences the economic value added of apprenticeships in terms of employment, productivity, and economic growth. There is also a need for research that evidences the value added of social and environmental benefits, for example, with regard to social inclusion, labor mobility, attitudes, workplace behavior, and work satisfaction."

        "6. Conclusion\n\nThe field of electrical engineering is poised for innovations and challenges in the coming years, as emerging technologies such as AI, machine learning, and renewable energy generation push the boundaries of knowledge and creativity. Given the rapid advancement of technology, it is paramount that new generations of engineers be not only aware of these developments but also actively involved in addressing the changes they foster. It is the responsibility of educators, businesses, and the government to adequately equip young people with the skills necessary to succeed in the coming years, or they will surely fall behind. It has been contended that electrical engineers must develop a diverse set of skills to address the future challenges of the field's growth, including business and management skills, in addition to a sound theoretical understanding of the principles of electrical engineering. To facilitate the development of these skills, the government should provide apprenticeships for undergraduate electrical engineers starting in their final year of study. In the long run, this would mitigate the issue of finding suitably qualified workers for future innovations, as apprenticeships would not only provide graduates with work experience but also influence the degree's content during study. While this may be perceived as impinging on universities' autonomy, it ought to be pointed out that this is already the case for medical degrees, with close ties between universities, hospitals, and health service providers. Therefore, by implementing structured apprenticeships for electrical engineering graduates, the future challenges and innovations of the field could be met in a timely and appropriate manner. (Tao et al.2023)\n\nThis essay has explored the expected innovations and challenges in electrical engineering, the skills required to address these, and the proposed role of government apprenticeships in the development of suitably skilled graduates. It has been argued that the government must take action to enable a sound electrical engineering workforce in future decades. Further research should focus on identifying the specific content of apprenticeships in order for them to adequately address this issue, their appropriate structure and duration, and the level of involvement required by universities and businesses to ensure they meet these aims. Additionally, research should be conducted into addressing perceived concerns, focusing on issues of organizations, universities, and businesses, to ensure that apprenticeships provide appropriately skilled graduates without undue stress on small businesses or impinging on universities' autonomy. 6.1. Summary of Key Findings\n\nThe field of electrical engineering is undergoing significant transformations, driven by rapid advancements in innovative technologies and scientific methods. This evolution presents various opportunities and challenges for electrical engineering professionals, particularly for those beginning their careers. The need to stay current with groundbreaking developments in the field, particularly in information technology and computer engineering, is crucial for meeting the growing interest in specializations such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Consequently, there is a strong desire within the field of electrical engineering to establish government-sponsored apprenticeships that equip graduates with essential skills and experience to tackle performance demands more effectively. Through a detailed exploration of the future of electrical engineering and the role of government\n\napprenticeships, several key findings emerge. First and foremost, electrical engineering is characterized by a distinct development path and varies significantly from other engineering fields, making it important to fully understand the complexities involved. Second, electrical engineering, being the foundation of the modern technological world, goes beyond the transformation of electrical energy but encompasses the responsible design of systems that create benefits for society. Third, while rapid innovations in technologies and designs present numerous opportunities for those in the field, they simultaneously generate unprecedented comprehension challenges regarding performance requirements and factors affecting the steady and fluent performance of electrical engineering designs, systems, and methods. Fourth, electrical engineering is an ongoing process of expansion that has been progressing for centuries and will unlikely reach an endpoint. Fifth, specialists in the field of electrical engineering are increasingly required to understand broader knowledge and foreign fields that augment primary engineering competencies. Finally, in response to the complexities and challenges experienced in the wider world of electrical engineering, government-sponsored apprenticeships with public and governmental organizations are proposed. Through properly organized job tasks, working processes, and a flexible time schedule, newly graduated electrical engineers would be provided with essential competencies and skills responsible for comprehending complex electrical systems and augmenting steady performance levels throughout their career path. 6.2. Future Directions for Research and Practice\n\nThe most important future directions follow four key areas related to electrical engineering and electrical engineering apprenticeship programs. The first future direction is that institutional and sustainability studies related to electrical engineering and electrical engineering apprenticeship programs in developed and developing countries can be taken up. There is a need for consistency in understanding and investigating the critical role of electrical engineering apprenticeship programs in fostering overall student development, with particular emphasis on innovation. The differences between apprenticeship programs in developed and developing countries can be taken up for enhancing knowledge regarding diverse curriculum frameworks planning. This would shed light on domain-specific variations in engineering apprenticeship programs, fostering comparative studies across other domains as well. This study strongly advocates for the need to take up such studies in the future. The second future direction is conducting ethnographic and phenomenological studies to unveil implicit theories, unseen rituals, and culturally situated understanding of electrical engineering apprenticeships in understanding innovations and challenges. The implications of complex approaches on knowledge would augment current understanding of electrical engineering and electrical engineering apprenticeship programs, illuminating the way to potential solutions to cope with real-life innovations and challenges. The third future direction is conducting systematic and comprehensive meta-reviews to unveil the snapshot of the status of electrical engineering apprenticeship pedagogy innovation, innovations, and challenges, and to inform the agenda of future mainstream research and practice. As per the broad assessment conducted, nothing has been published in peer-reviewed journals, and only two reports are published in non-refereed journals addressing innovations and challenges unifying the sub-domains of electrical engineering. The fourth future direction is the need for research studies addressing the issue of aligning electrical engineering apprenticeship curriculums to meet the unmet challenges of graduate destinations. This issue is globally prevalent but contextually different in premising challenges due to differences in educational paradigms and graduating intellectual capital across countries. Engineering education meeting global challenges in contextually compatible approaches is essential to remodel engineering apprenticeship curriculums accordingly. It challenges complex methodological approaches of understanding compatible mismatches, engendering conflicts of beliefs and certainties in reconstructing practices.

Les entreprises opérant dans le pays identifient l'augmentation du coût de la vie et la\n\nlenteur de la croissance économique comme le principal obstacle à la transformation\n\nde l'entreprise d'ici 2030. 85 % visant à améliorer les compétences de leur main-d'œuvre pour répondre aux\n\nprincipales tendances économiques. Les employeurs en Tunisie s’attendent à une augmentation particulièrement forte de\n\nla demande de compétences en matière de leadership et d'influence sociale, de pensée\n\ncréative et de compétences en matière d'IA et de big data. Sept employeurs sur dix prévoient de financer en interne leurs besoins en formation,\n\net environ 40 % visent à tirer parti de modèles de cofinancement hybrides, publics et\n\nprivés. 3\n\n1. Les prévisions des entreprises Tunisiennes quant à l'impact des\n\ngrandes tendances sur leurs activités\n\nLes\n\ntendances anticipées allant de\n\nl'adoption des\n\ntechnologies aux perspectives\n\nmacroéconomiques, en passant par la transition verte, les politique industrielles et les\n\nrestrictions commerciales, devraient entraîner une transformation des activités de nos\n\nentreprises tunisiennes au cours des cinq prochaines années. Comme illustré dans la figure ci-dessus, les entreprises interrogées (à l’échelle international,\n\nrégion MENA et en Tunisie) identifient l'élargissement de l'accès numérique comme la\n\ntendance la plus susceptibles de transformer leur organisation ; ces tendances devraient\n\ninfluencer en moyenne 56 % des organisations interrogées. Les tendances macroéconomiques suivantes, à savoir l'augmentation du coût de la vie et la\n\nfaible croissance économique, sont jugées les plus influentes pour les entreprises Tunisiennes\n\net celle de la région MENA. L'impact des investissements pour s’adapter au changement climatique a été considéré\n\ncomme la quatrième tendance macroéconomique la plus importante des entreprises\n\ntunisiennes. Les questions sociales et de travail et les conflits géopolitiques viennent ensuite. 2. Les Tendances professionnelles anticipées par les entreprises\n\nTunisiennes\n\nLes tendances macroéconomiques et la technologie devraient être à l'origine de perspectives\n\nmitigées en matière de création et de destruction d'emplois au cours des cinq prochaines\n\nannées, dans toutes les catégories d'emploi et dans tous les secteurs d'activité. 4\n\nL'enquête qui a été réalisée donne un aperçu du taux de rotation structurel du marché du\n\ntravail, à savoir le nombre de nouveaux emplois attendus, plus le nombre de postes qui\n\ndevraient être supprimés au cours de la période, divisé par la taille de la population active en\n\nquestion. Au cours des cinq prochaines années, 170 millions d'emplois devraient être créés et 92\n\nmillions d'emplois déplacés, ce qui représente un changement structurel du marché du travail\n\nde 22 % des 1,2 milliard d'emplois formels des données étudiés. Cela représente une\n\naugmentation nette de l'emploi de 7 %, soit 78 millions d'emplois. Emplois crées\n\nEmplois détruits\n\nEmplois stables\n\nPour le cas de la Tunisie, les résultats indiquent, un changement structurel du marché de\n\ntravail de 22%, d’ici les cinq prochaines années. Les spécialistes de l'IA et de l'apprentissage\n\nautomatique arrivent en tête des emplois à forte croissance. La majorité des postes à\n\ncroissance rapide figurant sur la liste sont des postes liés à la technologie. La majorité des\n\npostes en déclin rapide concernent principalement les ouvriers et les comptables, en raison\n\nde l'automatisation croissante, de la numérisation des processus, et de l'évolution des besoins\n\ndu marché.

Gestion de l'environnement\n\nEn Tunisie : L'IA occupe la première place, suivis par le leadership et l'influence sociale, la\n\npensée créative, et la cybersécurité, soulignant une attention particulière à la gestion des\n\ntalents et à l'innovation. Au niveau de la région MENA : Les compétences liées à la cybersécurité et l'IA sont les\n\nplus prioritaires, suivies par la culture technologique et la résilience. La gestion des talents et\n\nla pensée analytique sont également essentielles pour la région. Au niveau mondial : L'IA et la cybersécurité dominent, suivis par la culture technologique\n\net la pensée créative. La curiosité et l'apprentissage continu, ainsi que la gestion de\n\nl'environnement, font également partie des priorités globales. En résumé, bien que des compétences comme l'IA, la cybersécurité et la culture\n\ntechnologique soient cruciales partout, chaque région met l'accent sur des aspects spécifiques\n\ntels que le leadership et la gestion des talents en Tunisie, la pensée systémique au niveau de\n\n6\n\nla région MENA, et l'apprentissage tout au long de la vie au niveau mondial. Certaines\n\ncompétences essentielles, telles que l'empathie, l'enseignement, le souci du détail, et le\n\nmarketing, semblent maintenir leur pertinence à travers toutes les régions, sans une grande\n\névolution attendue dans leur importance. Ces compétences continueront à être clés pour le\n\ndéveloppement personnel et professionnel, bien que d'autres compétences comme l'IA et la\n\ncybersécurité dominent la croissance dans les prochaines années. 4. Stratégies en matière de main-d'œuvre\n\nLes entreprises tunisiennes interrogées déclarent à une large majorité, qu'investir dans\n\nl'apprentissage et la formation sur le lieu de travail et automatiser les processus sont les\n\nstratégies de main-d'œuvre les plus courantes qui seront adoptées pour atteindre les objectifs\n\ncommerciaux de leur organisation au cours des cinq prochaines années. En complément des stratégies internes qu’elles envisagent pour s’adapter aux évolutions du\n\nmarché de l’emploi, les entreprises expriment également des attentes vis-à-vis de politiques\n\npubliques alignées. D'après les résultats de l’enquête, les mesures les plus susceptibles\n\nd’améliorer l'accès aux talents entre 2025 et 2030 incluent :\n\nLe financement de la requalification et de l’amélioration des compétences (55 %\n\ndes entreprises). Une plus grande flexibilité dans les pratiques d’embauche et de licenciement (50\n\n%). La modification de la législation du travail relative au travail à distance (41 %). L’amélioration des systèmes d’éducation publique (41 %). Ces résultats illustrent une demande claire des entreprises pour un investissement public\n\nrenforcé dans le développement des compétences. L’objectif est d’assurer une meilleure\n\nadéquation entre la main-d’œuvre disponible et les besoins évolutifs de l’économie. 7\n\nDans un contexte marqué par des facteurs émergents tels que la fragmentation\n\ngéoéconomique croissante, l’augmentation du coût de la vie et l’adoption massive des outils\n\nd’IA sur le marché du travail, les grandes tendances mondiales façonnent un environnement\n\nde plus en plus complexe. Dans ce cadre, les décideurs politiques, les employeurs et les\n\ntravailleurs doivent naviguer dans une incertitude persistante. Cependant, le rapport souligne\n\ndes perspectives d’emploi mondiales fortement positives, accompagnées d’une réduction\n\nprogressive des compétences devenues obsolètes. Cela s'explique par l’impact tangible des\n\ninitiatives de requalification, d’amélioration des compétences et de redéploiement mises en\n\nœuvre ces dernières années, qui commencent à se refléter dans les données et à transformer\n\nla main-d'œuvre aux niveaux national et mondial. Le gap de compétences demeure le principal frein à la transformation pour la majorité de nos\n\nentreprises (80% des entreprises interrogées, à cet effet, il est nécessaire de :\n\nMettre en place des transitions professionnelles proactives et dynamiques dans un éventail\n\ncroissant de rôles professionnels. (Identification des compétences émergentes, système de\n\nrequalification,)\n\nAdopter un équilibre futur entre l’automatisation accrue et une augmentation des\n\ncompétences humaines (complémentarité homme-machine, optimiser l’automatisation...). Ces enjeux soulignent l'importance de politiques et de stratégies collaboratives pour\n\nsurmonter les défis liés à l’évolution rapide des exigences du marché du travail. 8\nAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP\n\nSkills for Employability and Productivity in Africa (SEPA) Action Plan, 2022–2025\n\nJuly 2022\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS LIST OF FIGURES ................................................................................................................ ii LIST OF BOXES ....................................................................................................................."

        "That requires measures to improve both the quantity and the quality of education. Specifically, it requires expanding access to schools in remote areas, increasing incentives to invest in education, developing a demand-driven education system in sync with employers’ needs, investing in nutrition to help poorer children, and building STEM and ICT capacity. Dr. Akinwumi A. Adesina, President, African Development Bank Group Foreword, African Economic Outlook 2020: Developing Africa’s Workforce for the Future\n\nTo support the rapidly changing demands in African economies, the education system needs to build skills in traditional professions—such as teachers, nurses, and lawyers—and in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Also urgent is the need to develop skills for micro, small and medium enterprises. Investment in technology and science will be at the centre of the Bank’s skills development agenda. To increase the supply of skilled workers, the Bank will step up its support for technical and vocational training linked to specific needs in the labour market, in both the formal and informal sectors, including the skills to create small businesses. It will also support programs for women studying in technical and scientific areas. AfDB, At the Center of Africa’s Transformation, Strategy for 2013–2022\n\niv\n\nWith the shortage of engineering, scientific, and digital skills in Africa, human capital remains a key constraint in preparing for the future of production shaped by the disruptive technologies of the 4IR. Absent major changes in education and training systems, this problem is likely to worsen. University education is concentrated in business administration, social sciences, education, and humanities, while the STEM studies that are crucial in a 4IR world are under-represented. For example, enrolment is under 10% in engineering and in natural sciences, mathematics, and statistics, and under 5% in information and communication technologies. To better prepare for the future of work, education and training institutions in Africa should give more emphasis to STEM subjects, with enhanced public–private sector collaboration to ensure that skill development is in tune with labour market needs.

        "Issouf M'para COULIBALY, Investment Officer, PIFD. vi\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe AfDB’s Skills for Employability and Productivity in Africa (SEPA) Action Plan, 2022–2025, presents a structured approach to operationalising its commitment to raising the skill levels of Africa’s workforce. The Plan builds on the Bank’s 2014–2022 Human Capital Strategy (HCS) achievements and underpins its commitment to Skills and Technology under the Ten-Year Strategy (TYS 2013–2022). SEPA is anchored to the 2016–2025 Jobs for Youth in Africa (JfYA) Strategy and will contribute to the goal of creating 25 million jobs and equipping 50 million young people with skills for productive employment and self- employment. SEPA seeks to bridge Africa’s skills gap, addressing skills mismatch and relevance to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), climate change and the green-economy agenda, and digital transformation in the labour market. The development of the SEPA Action Plan was a collaborative and consultative process. The stakeholders, including Regional Member Countries (RMCs), Development Partners, Private Sector representatives, and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), endorsed SEPA’s priority focus and affirmed its responsiveness to the continent's aspirations for a productive and skilled labour force. SEPA is aligned with the Bank’s strategic frameworks, and continental and global initiatives to advance Africa’s economic transformation. It is consistent with TYS 2013– 2022, and with its “Skills and Technology” priority. It is also in the spirit of the Bank’s 5th High 5 priority: Improve the Quality of Life of the People of Africa, and is central to the achievement of the other High 5s: Light Up and Power Africa, Feed Africa, Industrialise Africa, and Integrate Africa. Furthermore, SEPA is compatible with the African Union’s Agenda 2063, which prioritises actions to catalyse an education and skills revolution, with active promotion of science, technology, research, and innovation. It is also aligned with the United Nations 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), notably SDG4 on equitable education and skills development, SDG8 on inclusive growth, productive employmenti and decent work for all, and SDG1 on ending poverty. SEPA will contribute to building an innovative, productive, and skilled workforce to drive economic transformation and job creation with the overall goal of improving the quality of life of the people of Africa. This goal will be reached by: (i) reducing skills gaps and mismatches, (ii) increasing engagement in productive self-employment, (iii) increasing innovation aligned to industrialisation and development needs, and (iv) improving the policy and regulatory environment for skills related to the key sectors. SEPA is articulated around two mutually reinforcing areas of intervention: (i) expanding infrastructure for the development of demand-driven skills, and (ii) strengthening the enabling environment for skills development. Activities under SEPA will benefit young people and the entire labour force in addressing the skills gap and mismatch, which are widening because of evolving needs in the labour market driven by technological advances and the needs of the green economy. In line with the Board’s guidelines on sharpening the Bank’s strategic focus in the context of the High 5s, SEPA focuses on expanding infrastructure for STEM in Higher Education, TVET, digital skills, and online learning. SEPA will adopt and roll out a Skills Enhancement Zones (SEZ) approach that aims to develop a skilled workforce tailored to support value chain development, business growth, and attracting new industries to\n\nvii\n\nensure that industry can reach its potential in transforming African economies and creating employment1. SEPA will also support an environment that develops skills directly linked to industry needs and youth entrepreneurship. In this context, the Bank will leverage its unique role as a trusted partner, knowledge broker, and convenor to (a) harness strategic partnerships with African governments, development partners, training institutions and industry to support industry-relevant skills building and mobilising additional resources for skills development; and (b) improve regulatory and institutional capacity through sector reforms, technical and statistical capacities, and knowledge generation in order to strengthen management, quality assurance, and the regulatory environment. SEPA will further support an enabling environment for harnessing entrepreneurial skills and investing in youth enterprises in a systemic, scalable, and sustainable manner to expedite the JfYA’s job-creation agenda. The implementation of SEPA will be monitored and evaluated based on the detailed workstream/activities described in the Implementation Action Matrix (IAM), and the indicators and conceptual framework— the Theory of Change (ToC) and the Results Framework (RF). 1 More details on SEZ Flagship Program are provided in Annex III."

        "viii\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nBackground\n\nAfrica’s strong real GDP growth over the past two decades has not been translated 1.1 into robust, productive employment and has, moreover, worsened under the impact of COVID–19. Africa was the second fastest-growing region globally and maintained an average growth rate of 4.6% between 2000 and 2016 (OECD, 2018) and 3.4% between 2017 and 2019 (AfDB, 2021). However, with an average elasticity of employment to growth of 0.41 between 2000 and 2014 — lower than the ideal 0.7 that allows for employment and productivity growth (AfDB, 2018a) — 83% of the 18 million young people who enter the labour market in sub- Saharan Africa every year remain jobless or underemployed in the informal sector (Mo Ibrahim Foundation, 2019). A highly skilled labour force is associated with higher earnings for people, higher income for countries, and stronger cohesion in societies (World Bank, 2020b). Thus, the skills-growth-jobs nexus establishes a strong theoretical link between skills development and sustainable growth, provided complementary investments are made in the productive sectors of the economy. 1.2 by 6.9% in 2021 (Figure 1). Due to GDP contraction, an additional 30 million Africans descended into extreme poverty in 2020, then 39 million more in 2021, bringing the total to 465.3 million by 2021 (AfDB, 2021). This compounded the already high incidence of working poverty among the youth, with over 70% of working young people in sub-Saharan Africa and 25% in North Africa living in extreme or moderate poverty (ILO, 2016). However, the strong economic recovery in 2021 was followed by two major global crises: the persistence of the COVID–19 pandemic; and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These issues will continue to impact growth, which is thus projected to decelerate to 4.1% in 2022, reflecting these uncertainties and the ebbing of base effects, especially in countries that had emerged strongly from sharp pandemic-induced contractions (AfDB, 2022). Africa’s real GDP contracted by 1.6% in 2020 due to the COVID–19 pandemic but grew\n\n3,0-2,0-1,00,01,02,03,04,05,06,07,08,02011-15201620172018201920202021 (est.)2022(proj.)PercentYearsFigure 1: Africa GDP contracted in 2020 amid COVID-19 Pandemic GDP growth\n\nThe COVID–19 pandemic caused serious disruption to education systems globally 1.3 and revealed major weaknesses in African skills development systems. The pandemic worsened the state of education in Africa, where, in 2018 and prior to the pandemic, 33% of the global number of out-of-school adolescents (aged 12–18) were to be found (UNESCO, 2019). Part of the reason for this negative impact of the pandemic was the lack of ICT-based learning in Africa. According to a May 2020 joint ILO-UNESCO-World Bank survey on skills development, only 20% of respondents from Africa indicated that training was being provided through online and/or offline distance learning, compared to more than 60% in other regions of the world. Many teaching staff and university faculty are not trained in ICT integration in teaching and have never designed or delivered lectures through online means (Danner, 2018). 1\n\nRationale for the Bank’s investment in skills development\n\nThe Bank made commitments under the 15th replenishment of the African 1.4 Development Fund (ADF–15) and the 7th General Capital Increase (GCI–7) on “Building skills for jobs and expanding economic opportunities for youth”. The specific commitments include: developing skills and supporting Jobs for Youth, with targets of (a) at least 40% of Bank-ADF approved projects to integrate skills and jobs for youth by 2022; (b) fourteen innovation centres of excellence created and 30,000 youth and women reached across Africa by 2022; and (c) at least 10 projects supported to boost decent job creation and skills development through investments in TVET, STEM in higher education and ICT, with a strong focus on youth and women by 2022. Furthermore, the Bank’s selectivity principle on sharpening its strategic focus under the High 5s reinforces these commitments. SEPA will contribute to developing a skilled workforce for the implementation of the High 5s in critical sectors, such as agriculture, industry, energy, infrastructure, transport, mining, and health (see Table 3). Achieving and sustaining investments in the Bank’s High 5s requires a skilled labour force; thus, SEPA presents a structured tool for the Bank to meet its commitments. Africa needs a skilled labour force to achieve and sustain inclusive economic 1.5 growth and transformation. The East Africa Economic Outlook 2020 identified shortages in specialised high- and low-end technical and vocational skills as a threat to Africa’s industrialisation and integration (AfDB, 2020b). As more Regional Member Countries (RMCs) transition to middle-income status, they need skilled workers in all sectors. At the same time, rapid developments in technology and ICT are redefining the future of work in Africa (OECD, 2016; and WEF, 2017). The current and future workforce needs stronger STEM skills. Informed by lessons from the COVID–19 pandemic, addressing this challenge includes creating more online learning opportunities and digitalisation of service delivery. To obtain quality jobs or grow their own businesses, young people need the skills to innovate and adapt to the evolving needs of industry. 1.6 Limited funding of TVET and Higher Education (HE) by RMC governments and Development Partners (DPs) is a challenge. Public financing of TVET and HE has not kept pace with the increase in the number of potential students in the sub-sectors. RMCs invest only 0.2% of GDP in TVET and 0.9% in HE, compared to 1.24% for HE in high-income countries in 2018ii. The bulk of this expenditure is for salaries and operating costs (80%–90% for TVET), leaving a minimal share of investments for infrastructure. There is also low investment by DPs in TVET and HE in Africa (Table 1 and Annex VI). Of the $ 4.9 billioniii invested each year by DPs in the education sector in Africa between 2015 and 2018, only 39% was devoted to TVET and HE (AfDB, 2020d). About 13% of financing needs for skills development in Africa is covered by existing DP financing. An additional $40 billion is needed every year to finance education and skills development in Africa by 2030, and over 70% of this amount is required to fill the infrastructure gap (AfDB 2018b). Furthermore, only 0.4% of GDP is invested in Research and Development (R&D) in Africa compared to 1.7% globally (AfDB, 2018c). African countries’ investments in science and technology and TVET are too low to build the skills needed for industrialisation and manufacturing. 2\n\nTable 1: Funding of TVET and HEST by Development Partners in 2015–2018 ($ Million)\n\nFunding Sources\n\nTotal education sector\n\nTVET sector only\n\nHE (Post-Secondary) only\n\nNo of DPs\n\nTotal\n\nNo of DPs\n\nTotal\n\nAverage amount\n\nNo of DPs\n\nTotal Average per DP\n\nMultilaterals (including MDBs) Bilateral DPs Other DPs TOTAL\n\n7\n\n7,311.2\n\n37 12,390.6 231.8 4 48 19,933.6\n\n5\n\n29 2 36\n\n1,316.2\n\n1,122.1 5.0 2,443.3\n\n263.2\n\n38.7 2.5 67.9\n\n6\n\n32 1 39\n\n1,121.6\n\n4,566.8 0.1 5,688.4\n\n186.9\n\n142.7 0.1 145.9\n\nSource: AfDB 2020d. The Bank is well-positioned to support skills development in Africa, especially 1.7 infrastructure for STEM and TVET, in view of its comparative advantage in the sector. Several leveraging factors work in the Bank’s favour — its track record in infrastructure investments (TVET, HE and specifically in STEM); the various instruments it deploys including sector policy dialogue and analytical, technical and knowledge advisory services; as well as its convening power — and have contributed to making the Bank a partner of choice. Since 2005, the Bank’s strategic focus on infrastructure development in TVET and Higher Education, Science and Technology (HEST) has positioned it well to bring innovative solutions and to lead other partners in supporting Africa’s youth and increase access to industry-relevant skills for a more productive and innovative workforce. Box 1 summarises the Bank’s comparative advantage in the sector based on its own criteria. Box 1: Summary of the Bank’s Comparative Advantage in Skills Development\n\nTrack record of providing effective support to education infrastructure in TVET and STEM\n\n\n\nSince 1975, the Bank has been supporting the education sector. The strategic focus has evolved over time: 1986–2000, basic education; 2000–2005, sector-wide approach to educational development; 2005 to date, TVET and STEM. • Between 1975 and 2006 the Bank financed 168 education projects, 79% of which related to infrastructure. Between\n\n2014 and 2020 about 90% of approvals in education have been for TVET and HE. Growing Demand •\n\nThe financing gap in education and skills development is estimated at $40 billion annually, especially in TVET and HEST (AfDB, 2018b). Very few donors invest in TVET and HE. From 2014 to 2020, the Bank committed $916 million to TVET and HE. The Bank allocated 71% of its the total education commitment to TVET over the 2015–2018 period, which is high, compared to other multilateral institutions (World Bank [12%], EU [19%] and the Islamic Development Bank [12%]). The Bank allocated 20% of its total education commitment to HE compared to the World Bank (13%), the Islamic Development Bank (39%) and the EU (6%). (AfDB 2020d). The Bank’s special feature is its exceptionally high share of total approvals for education devoted to TVET. Among the top 11 donors to TVET in Africa, only Luxembourg and Switzerland allocate more than 25% of their education investments to TVET. The other multilateral development banks (MDBs) allocate between 12% and 19% of their total education investment to TVET. Increased operational focus and capacity in policy reforms, sector governance and private sector engagement in skills development •\n\nFrom its HEST (Higher Education, Science and Technology) Strategy (2008), the Bank began to place more emphasis on links between the education system, the productive sectors, and the private sector. Examples include HEST projects in Zambia, Uganda, and Kenya; and projects in support of Regional Centres of Excellence and HE institutions in the EAC and ECOWAS. Since 2014, the Bank has supported reforms in the sector that promote private-sector engagement in skills development to enhance relevance and create jobs for young people. Examples include Programme Based Operations (PBOs) related to skills, employability and entrepreneurship in Côte d’Ivoire, Morocco, Tunisia, and Rwanda. The Bank has human resource capacity that can be used to foster business development in skills, especially in sovereign operations, including 38 operational staff with technical expertise in education, skills development, and entrepreneurship. Convening power and partnership •\n\nLeveraging its convening power, the Bank has organised 3 high-level Africa Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) Policy Forums (2012, 2014 and 2018) with over 20 partners. The forums have attracted high-level policy makers, deepening and broadening commitment to advance science and technology. There is now increasing demand from RMCs for the Bank to convene continent-wide forums on TVET. 3\n\n2. SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA\n\nStatus and Key Challenges\n\nThe African continent is considered the least skilled in the world. The HE enrolment 2.1 rateiv in 2018 was 9% in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and 35% in North Africa, compared to 38% globally. Of the 199 million adolescents (aged 12–18) that are not in school, 65 million are in Africa, with girls representing 52% (UNESCO, 2019). African countries have not prioritised science, technology, and engineering, including at the tertiary levels of education. For example, the engineering, manufacturing, construction, and health sectors had only 19% of HE graduates in 2018 compared to 27% in developed economiesv.The gender gap is also pronounced — only 25% of female students at HE institutions are enrolled in STEM, compared to 34% of male students (AfDB, 2017b). The quality of learning at all levels of skills development is equally low compared to other regions. Only four African universities were in the Times Higher Education top 500 universities globally in 2020vi. African countries are also at the bottom of global rankings on performance in mathematics and science at all levels (OECD, 2019). 2.2 Inadequate industry-relevant skills constrain the transformation of Africa’s economies and limit inclusive growth and shared prosperity. Low value-added production patterns make African countries dependent on exports of raw materials, notably agricultural products (cocoa, coffee, tea, etc.) and mineral products (oil, gold, diamonds, cobalt, etc.)vii, creating wealth for foreign processors and manufacturers, exporting jobs, and leaving swathes of Africa in poverty. The skills mismatch affects productivity and value addition because of the weak links between entrenched education systems and the needs of labour markets. Some 46% of Africa’s employed youth perceive their skills as mismatched to their jobs (Mursy et al., 2019); and some 21% of business leaders reported that the lack of adequate skilled workers was a major constraint to their operations, with over 29% of production workers rated as unskilledviii. 2.3 Analysis of the context of skills in Africa highlights key constraints limiting economic transformation, skills development, and creation of productive jobs (Table 2). Table 2: Africa’s Overarching Development Problems and Related Key Constraints\n\nOverarching Problem\n\nKey Constraints related to skills development\n\nSlow economic transformation • Non-inclusive and jobless growth • High poverty and inequality\n\n\n\nInfrastructure gaps in quantity and quality for skills development, research, and innovation, including digital learning skills;\n\nShortages of TVET and STEM skills for industrial change, climate change, and the transition to a digital economy;\n\nSkills mismatch, poor quality and lack of relevance of skills to industry’s needs, and lack of entrepreneurship skills result in high unemployment among graduates;\n\nLow labour productivity and competitiveness of enterprises, especially in the informal sector, due to the lack of productive and entrepreneurship skills; • Enabling infrastructure (ICT connectivity, energy, transport, water) in short supply affecting quality and resilience of the core training infrastructure;\n\nWeak policy regulatory frameworks in TVET and HE, resulting in low emphasis on STEM, leading to low capacity in research and innovation; and • Limited financing for skills development and weak sector governance. 2.4 Weak emphasis on STEM has affected Africa’s capacity for research and innovation. STEM research constitutes only 29% of Africa’s total research output (Bloom et\n\n4\n\nal, 2016), despite the need for more research into energy, transport, light manufacturing, and the extractive industries. This is low, compared to over 67% in other developing countries, such as Malaysia and Vietnam. The gender gap is also wide, with females representing only one researcher in three in SSA. Africa’s share of global patent applications is less than 1%, and its share of global research output is only 3.8% (AfDB 2018c). Out of 129 countries included in the 2019 ranking of the World Intellectual Property’s Global Innovation Index, 19 of the bottom 30 countries are in Africa (WIPO, 2019). Africa lags behind in the creation of home-grown solutions to development challenges, as was shown during the COVID–19 pandemic that exposed the inadequacies in African skills development and triggered a deep reflection on the effectiveness of the current education model and capacity to innovate. As of September 2022, developed countries had vaccinated nearly 80% of their populations against COVID–19, while the African continental figure was barely over a quarter at 28%, partly due to lack of vaccine manufacturing capacity. Africa manufactures only 1% of vaccines administered on the continentix. TVET contributes to skilling youth for employability and value-chain 2.5 development, but African countries have not invested in TVET at scale. TVET may often be perceived as the last choice for students who fail to enrol in university or to pursue general education. In 2018, only about 13.4% of students in upper-secondary education were enrolled in vocational programmes in SSA, and 30.1% in North Africa, reflecting a marginal decline from 14.1% and 31.1%, respectively, in 2008 (AfDB 2020c). However, despite this overall downward trend, some progress has been made in some countries over the last decade, notably in Cameroon (+6%), Mozambique (+6%) and Niger (+15%) (AfDB 2020c). Women are also under-represented in trades perceived to be exclusive to males such as mechanics, welding, construction, carpentry, and electrical works. Lack of financial and policy support to the TVET sub-sector by governments may be contributing to low enrolments. In 2018, African countries allocated only 5% of their education budgets to TVET (AfDB 2020c). Africa has thus not fully leveraged the opportunities offered by TVET as a critical source of middle-level technical skills for driving industrialisation and value-chain development. 2.6 Insufficient quality infrastructure for skills development and research is affecting inclusive access and quality. Quality infrastructure for specialised skills in areas such as oil and gas, mining, and agro processing is beyond the reach of many RMCs, forcing Africans to seek skills training outside the continent, with many failing to return. A survey conducted by the Bank in 2020 indicated that 70% of African university leadership considers inadequate training infrastructure as the most significant barrier to STEM research and entrepreneurship development (AfDB 2020f). Investments in infrastructure development for TVET and STEM are being outpaced by demographic growth in many RMCs. For example, between 2013 and 2017 only 20% of TVET applicants in Tanzania were accorded a place. In Malawi, more than 13,000 youth applied for TVET admission in 2019, but only about 16% were able to enrol. The lack of gender-responsive infrastructure (e.g., hostels) has undermined female enrolment, which partly explains why females accounted for only 30% of the total TVET enrolment in 2020x. 2.7 ICT infrastructure and connectivity, which are key to ensuring quality service delivery, supporting continuity of learning, ensuring remote access, and increasing enrolments and outputs, are in short supply. In 2019, internet penetration in Africa averaged 39.6% compared to a global average of 62.7%xi. About 82.2% of households in Africa lack access to the internet in their homesxii compared to 43% worldwidexiii. ICT is an enabler in facilitating learning and acquiring skills for employability. Low internet penetration has put\n\n5\n\nmost of the African population, especially the youth, at a disadvantage in acquiring digital skills (AfDB, 2020a and 2020b). 2.8 While Africa is experiencing a vibrant wave of entrepreneurship, sustaining businesses is a challenge because of poor entrepreneurship skills and culture. Globally, universities on top of the Graduate Employability Rankingsxiv bridge academic learning with business incubation and entrepreneurship programmes; they nurture strong partnerships with industry to produce innovation and high levels of potential start-ups. The Global Entrepreneurship Index (GEI) emphasises entrepreneurship in education and skills development as foundational to anchoring productive enterprises in the labour market. In 2019, Tunisia was the only African country to rank among the top 50 countries globally in the GEI (42.4/100) owing to the availability of venture capital and high quality human capital in business and in STEM. A major strength of the Tunisian education system is that it equips a large proportion of students with basic entrepreneurship skills (OECD, 2012). Some 70% of the bottom 20 countries on the GEI are in Africa, due to poor quality of the entrepreneurial environment. Developing entrepreneurship skills in TVET and HE can enhance innovation and the culture of entrepreneurship, as well as enterprise competitiveness, while contributing to intellectual capital with extensive economic returns. It also has significant potential to reduce graduate unemployment. 2.9 Limited systemic support for skills upgrading in the informal labour force is hindering enterprise productivity. The informal sector remains the largest source of employment opportunities in Africa, especially for young people and women: 95% of young Africans are employed in the informal sectorxv, which is dominated by micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs)xvi, many of which are hindered in their growth by sub-standard skills, lack of access to affordable finance, quality business development services, and a weak enabling policy environment. Overall, almost 9 out of 10 work opportunities (86%xvii) are in the informal sector where, however, skills development faces several challenges, including limited regulation of apprenticeship training, poor pedagogical and technical competences of master craftspeople, and weak links to formal skills development systems. Challenges to equipping the youth with skills include: (i) low foundational skills; (ii) quality deficits of technical and vocational skills in the informal economy and informal apprenticeship; (iii) lack or insufficient availability of formal opportunities to acquire skills; and (iv) non-inclusive formal TVET provision that is neither oriented to the needs of the small formal economy nor to the large informal economy (World Bank 2019a, AfDB 2020c). 2.10 Developing skills in fragilexviii situations is a challenge. Long periods of conflict and war undermine efforts to build a skilled and productive labour force and are an important cause of low literacy levels. Civil conflict has destroyed education and training facilities, while the lack of skills has resulted in high unemployment and contributed to instability. In South Sudan, for example, some 72% of the adult population (81% of women) are illiterate and 42% of public-sector workers do not have higher than primary school education (World Bank, 2015); youth literacy was estimated at 44%, while half of secondary-school-age children and adolescents do not attend school. Emerging Opportunities for Skills and Entrepreneurship Development\n\n2.11 Labour market needs are evolving due to technological advancement. Emerging issues such as climate change demand new solutions. Technology and ICT are rapidly changing and defining the future of work (OECD, 2016), requiring a more skilled workforce heavily\n\n6\n\nweighted towards STEM professionals. ICT literacy is expected to be at the centre of core skill requirements for many industries (WEF, 2016). Some 230 million digital jobs are projected to be created in Africa by 2030xix. Some countries, notably Ethiopia, Ghana, South Africa, and Mauritius, are already gearing up by developing Digital Transformation Strategies/Action Plansxx, presenting the Bank with an opportunity to support such transformational initiatives. Job displacement is also an issue, as much of the continent’s current employment is low-skilled and labour-intensive, with a significant risk of displacement by automation, which implies reskilling and upskilling. 2.12 The deepening of African economic integration through the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) presents an opportunity to accelerate industrialisation and job creation. For RMCs to harness the benefits of the AfCFTA, they need to equip their workforces with technical and entrepreneurial skills value-chain leading to in development, growth trade manufacturing, and facilitation the example of East Africa). The AfCFTA also increases the demand for highly skilled labour and opens skills opportunities mobility. This calls for harmonisation and recognition of education and skills qualification frameworks across the continent. Box 2: Skills and Regional Integration ‘Transformation towards services and regional integration in East Africa is expected to boost the region’s demand for educated and skilled labour. The Northern Corridor Integration Project (NCIP) and Central Corridor Initiative have created a workforce demand of 4,500–15,500 for maritime transport and shipping logistics in ten years, while Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport (LAPSSET) is to generate 200,000 jobs through port and related activities. The NCIP’s regional demand for Information and Communications Technology (ICT) skills is expected to increase to between 8,300 and 30,600 skilled ICT workforce, while a regional strategy for scaling up access to modern energy services will demand 12,044 professional and technical staff in the geothermal industry’. Source: AfDB East Africa Economic Outlook Report 2020\n\n(Box 2,\n\nfor\n\n2.13 Another big opportunity for skills and job creation stems from the strong and pervasive entrepreneurial spirit across the continent. Africa accounts for the world’s largest share of start-ups, but they are often in sectors where productivity remains low (AfDB, 2017a). Investment in the entrepreneurship ecosystem and the green economy will increase innovation, harness the culture of entrepreneurship, and contribute to the development of intellectual capital. In 2018, some 442 innovation hubs were established in cities such as Lagos, Cape Town, Accra, Nairobi, and Cairo. The rapid rise in entrepreneurship is due to the increase in start-up funding of up to $560 million made available for the establishment of IT-related innovations (African Union, 2019). Africa is also experiencing an influx of the diaspora into start-up businesses, especially in digital systems. 7\n\n3. THE BANK’S SUPPORT TO SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA\n\nThe Bank’s Portfolio in Skills Development\n\n3.1 alone projects and their integration in sector projects. Between 2014 and 2020, the Bank committed about UA 694 million2 in loans and grants to the education sector, out of which 90.2% supported TVET and HE (Figure 2). About 55% of the total approvals in volume were core lending to ADB- member countries, while 43% were through the ADF window. The highest number of approved projects (31 of 46) were ADF-funded compared to 8 projects via ADB core funding and 7 through the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), the MIC Technical Assistance Fund (MIC-TAF) and the Special Relief Fund (SRF). The average project size of an ADB-funded project (UA 47.9 million per project) was about four times the average size of a stand-alone ADF-funded project (UA 10.9 million). With the GCI– 7 commitments and based on the principles of selectivity, SEPA will invest in fewer, but larger and more strategic and transformative operations. Skills development is an integral part of the Bank’s portfolio both through stand-\n\nSource: AfDB (2021)\n\nTVET65,53%Secondary Education7,75%Cross Sector0,02%Higher Education24,64%Basic Education2,05%Figure 2: UA 694 million committed over 2014-2020 for Education/Skills Development, out of which 90% was allocated to TVET and Higher Education\n\nAll the five sub-regions of the continent benefited from the Bank’s investments in 3.2 skills development between 2014 and 2020, although with some imbalance. There were more approvals in volume terms in East Africa (28%), North Africa (19%), and Southern Africa (22%). A high number of projects (12/46) in West Africa were approved but, due to the small volume of funding, the region only accounted for 16% of the total. Central Africa attracted fewer investments (16% of the volume). About 16% of total approvals went to transition countries, demonstrating the Bank’s strong track record in education and skills development in fragility contexts. Multi-regional operations accounted for 2% of total approvals. The Bank’s Achievements\n\nThe Bank’s investments in TVET and HE in RMCs have yielded significant 3.3 developmental results that need to be scaled up (Box 3). SEPA will enhance monitoring, evaluation, and learning systems.

These interventions ranged from policy dialogue and sector reforms to specific investment projects. In the policy area, the Bank has been leading high-level policy dialogues on Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) since 2012. Through STI forums, the Bank has promoted STEM and innovation in skills development. Between 2012 and 2018, the Bank held three STI forums, an indication of its strategic and catalytic role in promoting investments in STI for Africa’s growth and competitiveness (see Box 4). Box 4: Incentivising RMCs to invest more and smartly in STEM, and Research and Innovation Capacities for job creation through the STI Forum. The Bank has supported 3.5 reforms in the skills sector to enhance inclusive access, efficiency, quality, and relevance. One of the areas of the promotion private-sector engagement in education and skills development. Examples of funded projects with significant sector-reform the measures since 2013 Zambia Science, Technology and Education Project; Rwanda Skills for Employability and Entrepreneurship Program (SEEP, I, II & III), Uganda HEST Project, and the Morocco Training-Employment Matching Support Program (PAAFE). The Bank has also conducted analytical work on national innovation systems — for example, in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Morocco. These analytical works helped to foster the Bank’s dialogue and strengthen collaboration with other DPs in TVET and STEM. The first forum, in Nairobi, Kenya, 2012, connected STI efforts in Africa to global sustainable development processes. It further informed the Bank’s Human Capital Strategy (HCS) 2014–2018. The second forum (Rabat, Morocco, 2014) focused on: (i) assessing the state of STI in Africa; (ii) showcasing global best practices; (iii) promoting innovative uses of ICT; (iv) jobs; and (v) spurring strategic enhancing skills development and partnerships on STI. The third forum (Cairo, Egypt, 2018) focused on improving research relevance to catalyse innovations and usable goods and services through the support of the private sector in five selected clusters: climate change/green jobs and green economy; agro-industry/nutrition; water; ICT; and the pharmaceutical industry. reform has been\n\nof\n\ninclude\n\nto\n\nSupport\n\nKey outcomes for the Bank include: (i) Increased business development in STI/TVET-focused projects aimed at boosting youth employability, entrepreneurship and innovation for employment in Africa; (ii) Fostering stronger and better coordinated STI strategic partnerships/collaboration at regional level to promote STEM skills, especially for girls; and (iii) Enhanced capacities amongst TVET and HE Institutions in RMCs for STEM skills to contribute to the creation of more youth employment opportunities. Source: AfDB: HCS Management Implementation Review, 2020. 3.6 Integrating skills development into the Bank’s other operations has facilitated the implementation of the High 5s by supporting agribusiness, transport, industry, and energy sectors. In Ghana, the 2017 Savannah Zone Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project (SAZAPIP) focuses on agricultural value chain for food and nutrition security, and localised job and wealth creation. In Morocco, the Support Programme for Inclusive and Sustainable Development of the Agriculture Sector (PADIDFA, 2018–2019) promoted agricultural sector reforms. The programme enabled the training and qualification of nearly 200 trainers and managers, 2,000 graduates as technicians and specialised workers, and the certification of around 5,000 young farmers who have benefited from apprenticeship trainingxxi. In Rwanda, the Skills Development in the Energy Sector (SDES) Project contributed to the creation of tools needed for increasing the availability of a skilled workforce for the energy sector, contributing to efforts to increase competitiveness and productivity in the energy sector. 3.7 To contribute to innovation, the Bank has financed regional operations such as the Pan African University (PAU) Project to support the development of quality HE and research in Africa. The project has promoted innovations in Science, Engineering, Agriculture, Biotechnology, Social Sciences, Humanities and University Governance. The PAU was designed as an academic network of existing post-graduate and research institutions with 5 Institutes, each specialising in one thematic area, located in each sub-region of the continent. The 5 thematic areas and locations are: West Africa, Earth and Life Sciences\n\n9\n\n(including Health and Agriculture); North Africa, Water and Energy Sciences (including Climate Change); Central Africa, Governance, Humanities and Social Science; East Africa, Basic Sciences, Technology, and Innovation; and Southern Africa, Space Sciences. Lessons learned\n\n3.8 SEPA is enriched by the lessons learned from the implementation of the HCS. These include the findings and conclusions of the Mid-Term Review (MTR), the Management Implementation Review (MIR), and related project completion reports, as well as lessons learned from implementing the JfYA between 2016 and 2021 and the experience of other development partnersxxii (Box 5). Detailed information on how the lessons learned are considered in the formulation of SEPA is provided in Annex IVxxiii. Box 5: Key lessons learned by the Bank ➢ Human capital needs on the continent are imposing and evolving. Demographic trends indicate that these needs will continue rising, providing opportunities for continued investment in human capital, with a focus on demand-driven skills-development programmes and projects. The Bank cannot adequately address all of them; therefore, partnerships with other stakeholders, including the private sector, are necessary to bring interventions to scale. ➢ Maintaining STI as a key focus area for future interventions is critical. The review of the Bank’s Human Capital Strategy 2014–2021 stressed the need for the Bank to maintain science and technology as a strategic focus area to support Africa’s socio-economic transformation. The reviews also emphasised the need for the Bank to scale up STI to link skills development with productive sectors according to demand. These areas remain relevant and critical in the current context of the industrialisation and manufacturing/value addition agenda and the AfCFTA. ➢ Infrastructure deficits in HE and TVET remain the biggest constraint to improving the quality of Africa’s workforce. The Bank’s interventions need selectively to support investments in quality infrastructure for these sub-sectors. ➢ Building more relevant skills development ecosystems, ensuring private-sector engagement in education and training systems to mitigate shocks and fragility. The Bank’s support to reforms in the sector highlighted the need for strong partnerships between education/skills development and the private sector to improve relevance, promote research and enhance private financing. There is a need to build a more relevant skills development ecosystem by promoting national frameworks that ensure private-sector engagement in education and training systemsxxiv. ➢ Accelerate investments in digital infrastructure and solutions to build strong and resilient skills development systems in RMCs and Regional Hubs. The COVID–19 pandemic has accentuated the need for the Bank to mobilise more co-financing adequately to meet the demand from its RMCs, invest in digital skills, and support skills development systems that are resilient to shocks and fragility. ➢ Integration of entrepreneurship in TVET and higher education curriculums helps harness entrepreneurship skills and promotes the links between university and industry under the Triple Helix Model (connection between academia, the private sector and government). This is critical for equipping the future labour force with productive skills for self-employment, thereby addressing high graduate unemployment and limited access to productive jobs. ➢ A strategic focus on skills development infrastructure should go hand in hand with strengthening the enabling environment to ensure high-performing infrastructure in terms of accessibility, efficiency, relevance, resilience and sustainability. ➢ Forging strong collaboration with the private sector in specialised skills training. This is based on the experience of the labour-intensive and specialised sectors (oil & gas, agriculture, mining industry) where the private sector has financed specialised skills development centres to meet their needs. ➢ Operational capacity for Action Plan implementation: Close attention should be paid to staffing, smart managing of talent and expertise, timely resource allocation and robust Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework. 10\n\n4. SETTING AREAS OF INTERVENTION UNDER SEPA\n\nLinking SEPA to the JfYA Strategy\n\nSEPA is anchored to the Jobs for Youth in Africa (JfYA) Strategy, 2016–2025, and 4.1 will contribute to the achievement of its overall goal of creating 25 million jobs for young people and equipping at least 50 million youth with skills to realise their full economic potential. JfYA is being implemented through three strategic pillars: integration, innovation, and investment. It promotes inclusive employment and entrepreneurship, aims to strengthen human capital, and contributes to creating durable labour market linkages. JfYA flagship programmes focus on equipping the youth with entrepreneurial and digital coding skills, which enable RMCs to respond to rapid skills demands, thus fostering better pathways to productive self-employment, efficient school-to-work transition, and enhanced skills for industry needs. Following the expiry of the HCS, SEPA will scale up the skills component of JfYA. SEPA expands support to STEM in HE and TVET, digital technology beyond coding, and online learning skills infrastructure, while supporting an environment that develops skills directly linked to jobs and youth entrepreneurship by rolling out the Skills Enhancement Zone (SEZ) approach. It also addresses skills gaps, mismatch, and relevance in the labour force on the back of the 4IR, green-growth and green-economy agendas, digital transformation, and evolving needs in the labour market. SEPA sets the Bank’s framework for targeted investments to build relevant skills that promote youth employability and gender equality. Figure 3 presents the link between JfYA and SEPA, while Annex III contains more details on JfYA. Figure 3: Link between SEPA and JfYA\n\n11\n\nGuiding Principles\n\n4.2 SEPA aligns with the guiding principles of the JfYA Strategy: (i) strengthening core competencies (STEM, digital/online learning, and entrepreneurial competencies); (ii) amplifying existing work, which implies building on the achievements of the HCS and JfYA, especially in digital coding and entrepreneurship; (iii) fostering collaboration, both within and outside the Bank; (iv) applying a strategic approach by integrating high-impact activities, and undertaking activities in a phased approach; and (v) using private-sector instruments to boost the development of demand-driven skills in priority economic sectors. Based on the Bank’s comparative advantage and commitments in the ADF–15 and the GCI–7, SEPA is also guided by additional principles including (i) selectivity, (ii) collaboration and (iii) complementarity. 4.3 Selectivity: The Bank will focus on areas where it can demonstrate concrete comparative advantage and value addition (Box 1). The Bank will focus on financing climate-smart and sustainable skills infrastructure, strengthening capacity in skills-development institutions, and engaging in evidence-based policy dialogue with RMCs in line with the Bank’s Selectivity Guidelinesxxv. Notably, SEPA will focus on STEM in HE and TVET, digital and online learning infrastructure, with attention to efficiency and quality infrastructure. Adhering to the selectivity guidelines, SEPA will not typically support general education at the primary and secondary levels but could, exceptionally, support STEM in secondary education in fragility contexts. Through policy dialogue and technical assistance, the Bank will support RMCs in their efforts to mobilise resources from other DPs for investment in science infrastructure at the lower levels of education to build a strong pipeline to produce students for advanced STEM education at higher education. 4.4 Collaboration and partnership: The Bank will deepen collaboration and partnerships with the private sector, other DPs, UN agencies, reputable academic and research institutions, and civil society organisations to produce results with maximum impact. The Bank will also align its interventions with international, continental, regional, and national policies and strategies, encouraging strong buy-in and shared ownership with RMCs. Complementarity: SEPA complements other strategies under the High 5s to 4.5 address specific skills gaps in the relevant sectors of the Bank’s operations (Table 3). These include the Bank’s Strategy on Feed Africa; the New Deal on Energy for Africa; the Industrialization Strategy, the Regional Integration Policy and Strategy; the Strategy on Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience in Africa; the JfYA Strategy; the Gender Strategy; the Governance Strategy; the Capacity Building Strategy; and others, including those that are under development. Addressing these specific skills gaps will facilitate effective implementation of the Bank’s operations. In the spirit of the “One Bank” approach, SEPA will promote joint operations with other sectors such as Transport, Water and Sanitation, Health, Agriculture, Industrialization, ICT, and Governance. Table 3: Link Between SEPA and the Bank’s High 5 Priorities\n\nHigh 5s Industrialize Africa\n\nLink with SEPA SEPA will support the creation of a skilled workforce, including middle-level technicians, engineers, and other professionals who will promote production and innovation to exploit national, regional, and global supply chains. SEPA will pay attention to developing digital skills to enhance Africa’s capacity to participate competitively in the 4IR. SEPA will ensure collaboration with the PITD Department. 12\n\nHigh 5s Feed Africa\n\nIntegrate Africa\n\nLight Up and Power Africa\n\nImprove the Quality of Life for Africans\n\nLink with SEPA SEPA will equip the youth with relevant skills in agri-business and scientific research to support agro- industry, including value-chain development. It will also promote innovations for improving agricultural productivity and value addition. SEPA will focus on continental skills mobility to advance AfCFTA objectives. This will require improved curricula and quality-assurance standards in TVET and HEST. Specifically, SEPA will support the scaling up of regional centres of excellence, with a focus on the critical skills needed to transform Africa and on harmonisation of the qualification frameworks across the continent to facilitate labour mobility. This will ultimately help advance the creation of more regional centres of excellence in alignment with the GCI–7 commitments. Special attention will be paid to developing skills to support the development of renewable energy to facilitate universal access to electricity and underpin the creation of green jobs and a green economy. Energy is critical to building and maintaining technology advancement and SEPA will nurture strong synergy with the African Network of Centre of Excellence in Energy (ANCEE-RACEE) to improve skills in the sector. SEPA will support skills development, especially among the youth and women, to promote productive jobs. It will also support skills development in the health, and water and sanitation sectors to enhance quality service delivery and innovation. Goal, Objectives, and Theory of Change\n\nThe overall goal of SEPA is to improve the quality of life of the people of Africa 4.6 through a productive and innovative workforce. This goal will be reached through four objectives: (i) reduced skills gaps and mismatches; (ii) increased engagement in productive self- employment; (iii) increased innovation aligned to industrialisation and development needs; and (iv) improved sector policy environments. SEPA is underpinned by a Theory of Change (ToC) based on robust evidencexxvi. 4.7 The ToC flows from the fundamental logic that increasing the supply of demand driven TVET, STEM and digital skills will facilitate the building of a critical mass of skilled labour that is innovative, productive, and entrepreneurial. The strategic thrust of SEPA is a game changer as it emphasises the connection between skills supply and demand, thus minimising skills mismatch. SEPA recognises the strong links between skills and economic transformation, focusing on skills for industrialisation, for improved productivity, and for value-chain development. Under the assumption that the industrial sector expands to create jobsxxvii and that adequate complementary investments are made in the productive sectors of the economy, the ToC assumes that the supply of quality and relevant TVET, STEM and digital skills will improve employability, promote job-creating growth, and contribute to improved quality of life for the African population. 13\n\nFigure 4: SEPA Theory of Change\n\nBank Areas of Intervention\n\nOutputs of RMCs\n\nShort-term Outcomes\n\nMid-term Outcomes\n\nImproved TVET, STEM, innovation, online/digital learning, and entrepreneurship infrastructure constructed or rehabilitated, and equipped\n\nReduced skills gap and mismatch\n\nInvesting in Skills Development Infrastructure\n\nDeveloped/reviewed demand driven curricula for TVET, HE and entrepreneurship\n\nEnhanced capacities of STEM teachers and TVET instructors built\n\nIncreased engagement in productive self- employment\n\nIncreased labour productivity and enterprise competitivenes s\n\nTrained youth in relevant TVET, STEM, entrepreneurship, and future work skills\n\nSupported inventors and innovators to develop patents in STEM related fields\n\nIncreased innovation aligned to industrialisatio n and development needs\n\nReduced unemployment and under- employment\n\nStrengthening the Enabling Environment for Skill Development\n\nDeveloped resource mobilisation mechanisms for skills development\n\nMobilised private sector investment in skills development\n\nIncreased capacities to innovate\n\nDeveloped policies and strategies prioritising TVET, STEM, ICT, and innovation\n\nImproved sector policy environment\n\nAssumptions: 1.

Barriers to starting small scale businesses are lowered. 5. Continued economic growth, especially in labour-intensive industries. 6. More youth become opportunity-driven entrepreneurs. 7. Private sector and MSMEs are expanding enough to create more jobs. Areas of Intervention\n\nSEPA is organised around two areas of intervention (AIs) and five operational 4.8 objectives (OOs), as well as cross-cutting themes. An overview of the AIs and their corresponding OOs is presented in Table 4, while the SEPA Implementation Action Matrix\n\n14\n\nGoal\n\nImproved quality of life of the people of Africa\n\n(IAM) in Annex II contains detailed work streams and activities. AI.1 focuses on the development of quality infrastructure for skills and is the core of SEPA, while AI.2 focuses on the enabling environment, which covers the ‘soft’ aspects of SEPA. About 90% of resources for SEPA will be devoted to infrastructure development while the remaining 10% will go to the enabling environment intervention area. SEPA pays close attention to the efficiency of investments that result in real skills acquisition and sustainable job creation. This is addressed by AI.2 through support to demand-driven curricula, sector reforms and governance, and building statistical and M&E capacities. The Bank will also support the development of Skills Strategies/Action Plans in RMCs to facilitate close alignment of SEPA with RMCs’ own strategic frameworks. Table 4: Summary of SEPA Areas of Intervention and Operational Objectives\n\nAreas of Intervention 1. Investing in skills- development infrastructure 2. Strengthening the enabling environment for skills development Integrating cross- cutting themes\n\nOperational Objectives\n\n1.1: Expand quality HE infrastructure with a focus on STEM 1.2: Expand market-oriented TVET infrastructure 1.3: Expand infrastructure for digital skills and online learning 2.1: Harness strategic partnership and resource mobilisation 2.2: Improve regulatory and institutional capacity\n\nEntrepreneurship Fragility Gender Climate change\n\nSocial inclusion\n\nKnowledge Generation\n\nArea of Intervention 1: Investing in Skills Development Infrastructure\n\n4.9 OOs:\n\nTo deliver on this area of intervention effectively, the Bank will focus on three\n\nOO.1: Expand quality of HE infrastructure with a focus on STEM\n\n4.10 A workforce equipped with quality STEM skills is crucial to fostering innovation and building a knowledge economy. The Bank’s investments in STEM infrastructure aim to improve the relevance and quality of STEM skills, while promoting equitable access to training and research facilities. Towards this Objective, the Bank will support investment in inclusive, quality STEM infrastructure (construction, expansion, rehabilitation, equipment) in RMCs to address related constraints in skills development. The Bank will also support the establishment of centres of excellence to enhance innovation, research and development (R&D), and harmonisation of skills development for skills mobility. OO.2: Expand Market-Oriented TVET infrastructure\n\n4.11 The urgency of focusing on skills development through TVET is underscored by the high demand for mid-level skilled workers (technicians) for value-chain development and manufacturing. TVET can be a pathway to providing skills needed by young people for productive self-employment. Technical and vocational skills among the youth are also becoming critical tools for promoting peace and inclusiveness in fragile contexts, and for supporting livelihoods in rural economies. For this Objective, the Bank will support investments in the construction and rehabilitation of TVET infrastructure, the acquisition of equipment, and the purchase of teaching and learning materials. Emphasis will also be placed\n\n15\n\non digital infrastructure enhancements in TVET institutions and support to the development of effective employment promotion services and incubation. To ensure availability of relevant skills required especially by industrial clusters (manufacturing, agro-industrial processing, ICT etc.), SEPA will support establishment of Skills Enhancement Zones (SEZs) within industrial parks or special economic zones. Special emphasis will also be placed on promoting infrastructure development that enhances the learning environment for girls. OO.3: Expand infrastructure for digital skills and online learning\n\n4.12 Technological transformation is changing skills agenda and the way people learn and work. Digitalisation of systems and service delivery is growing, along with the demand for digital skills, making some existing skills obsolete. Furthermore, the COVID–19 pandemic has exposed inadequacies in the use of digital technology in learning, service delivery, and workspace in Africa. For Africa to benefit from the emerging economic opportunities, to be competitive and to reap the benefits of the 4IR, the continent needs to develop a workforce that is fit for purpose. Towards this Objective, the Bank will support investment in ICT infrastructure for digital-skills development and ICT access for education resilience and continuity during times of crisis, e.g., pandemics or conflict. Thus, SEPA will support investments in the development of e-learning infrastructure through the establishment of e- learning platforms and the deployment of Open and Distance e-Learning (ODeL). To complement the Bank’s Coding for Employment platform implemented under the JfYA, SEPA will support investments in innovative ICT infrastructure in skills training facilities that promotes fast data transfer, and establishment of digital hubs to improve digital access and connectivity. SEPA will collaborate with PITD in promoting ICT infrastructure and internet connectivity. Area of Intervention 2: Strengthening the Enabling Environment for Skills Development\n\nOO.4: Harness strategic partnerships and resource mobilisation\n\n4.13 Enhancing the efficiency of interventions that improve the matching of skills and labour-market demand requires strategic partnerships with industry. To achieve this Objective, the Bank will support RMCs’ partnering with the private sector and industry for students to acquire on-the-job training through internships, SEZs, and curriculum and entrepreneurship development. The Bank will also support twinning arrangements and strategic partnerships with renowned universities and technical institutions for better quality skills and practices that meet international standards. A good example of such partnership is the Bank’s support to Rwanda through the Regional ICT Centre of Excellence in Rwanda (also known as Carnegie Mellon University Africa), which is producing high-quality ICT engineers. The Bank will deploy its convening power for resource mobilisation for skills 4.14 development, especially for non-sovereign operations (NSO)xxviii, through public-private partnerships (PPPs), direct funding and in-kind support to position the continent better in the era of 4IR. The Bank will enhance collaboration with the African Union and its Education, Science, Technology, and Innovation (ESTI) Commission for innovative financing in TVET and STEM to tap into the Bank’s forthcoming African Education, Science, Technology, and Innovation Fund (AESTIF) and international co-financing facility for education. The Bank will assist RMCs to develop innovative and sustainable financing mechanisms for skills development, and for research and development (R&D)xxix. 16\n\nOO.5: Improve regulatory and institutional capacity\n\n4.15 Building on the Bank’s experience of policy-based lending and institutional support, SEPA will support RMCs in reforms that reinforce an enabling environment for skills development. Strengthening the management, co-ordination, governance, and regulatory environment of skills development in the TVET and HE sub-sectors is critical for enhancing the efficiency of investments. The Bank will support reforms under this Objective that (i) promote the relevance and quality of skills development through the participation of the private sector and industry; (ii) enhance access and equity, especially for girls and disadvantaged youth; (iii) improve co-ordination and governance systems in the skills eco-system; and (iv) increase national and DP funding for skills development. The Bank will deploy policy dialogue with RMCs and the private sector to support reskilling workers whose skills have become obsolete due to technological advancement, adoption of a green-growth agenda, and the impact of digital transformation. The Bank will also support regional policy reforms promoting skills mobility and the harmonisation of qualification frameworks to foster regional integration. To enhance the efficiency of its interventions further, and in line with the Bank Group’s Capacity Development Strategy, and the Bank’s statistical capacity building programmes, it will strengthen statistical, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacities in TVET and HE institutions, supporting tracer and employers’ surveys to inform skills needs and employment outcomes and assess the relevance of graduates to their eventual employment. Through SEPA, the Bank will enhance knowledge generation and dissemination and promote evidence-based policies in TVET and HE. Cross-cutting Themes\n\nEntrepreneurship: Training in entrepreneurial skills is under-emphasised in TVET 4.16 and HE institutions. In a move to correct this, SEPA will (i) integrate entrepreneurship into training curricula and qualification frameworks, and (ii) develop entrepreneurship and business infrastructure (incubators, accelerators, and maker spaces and fab labsxxx) within learning institutions to enhance the competitiveness of the labour force. The triple helix model (connection among academia, the private sector, and communities) will be promoted as a catalyst for relevance and innovation. SEPA will support industrial skills hubs, principally in industrial parks. Partnerships with the private sector will be emphasised in the funding, running, and management of entrepreneurship-related infrastructure and facilities. 4.17 SEPA will reinforce the JfYA emphasis on building and scaling up youth entrepreneurship ecosystems to ensure more coherent and effective access to financial and technical capacity support for youth entrepreneurs, as well as improving the business environment. SEPA will focus on providing quality non-financial services by deepening the provision of technical skills for entrepreneurship training and mentorship. SEPA also supports the Bank’s operationalisation of new initiatives that enhance youth entrepreneurship such as the Youth Entrepreneurship Investment Bank (YEIB). YEIB aims to support the growth and survival of youth enterprises that can create jobs and contribute to the sustainable economic development of Africa. 4.18 Gender Mainstreaming: In line with Pillar 2 of the Bank’s Gender Strategy 2021– 2025, “Accelerating employability and job creation for women through skills enhancement”, SEPA will tackle the issues responsible for gender barriers to skills development. The Bank will undertake initiatives to bridge the gender gap in its interventions through gender mapping in SEPA-supported projects and programmes. The Bank will also support affirmative policies\n\n17\n\nfor girls to pursue STEM-related courses in higher institutions and enter male-dominated trades in TVET. 4.19 Climate Change: SEPA will contribute to the Bank’s efforts to address climate change and the green-growth and green-economy agendas, in line with the Bank’s climate change and green-growth strategy (CC&GG 2021–2030). In this context, the Bank will support skills training and innovations that promote green technologies and address local, regional, and global environmental concerns. CC&GG recognises the need to pay attention to: (i) improving awareness, knowledge of climate change (and related job opportunities) among the youth through the integration of climate change and environmental issues in school curricula, particularly in STEM subjects; and (ii) expanding the involvement of women and young entrepreneurs in climate-smart and green innovations. SEPA will promote the emergence of a talent pool among the youth to develop solutions to cope with climate-change and green- economy challenges, and low-carbon development. SEPA will comply with the Bank’s mandate of climate-change marking in its supported operations, as well as its social and environmental standards, as defined in its Integrated Safeguards System. 4.20 Fragility: Prolonged conflict, vandalism, insecurity, and underinvestment in the context of social, economic, and political fragility destroy education infrastructures and imperil skills development. SEPA activities in fragility situations will be implemented in the context of the Bank’s new Strategy for Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience in Africa (2022–2026). Priority area 3 of the Strategy focuses on ‘‘Catalyzing private investments for job creation and inclusive economic development”. The areas of skills development in the Strategy are vocational training and entrepreneurship, with special attention to youth- and women-owned businesses. It prioritises support to start-ups and SMEs development to spur domestic value- chain development. Considering the orientation of the Strategy, SEPA will (i) focus on developing entrepreneurship skills for enterprise growth, and (ii) support TVET, STEM and digital skills infrastructure for value-chain development to boost productivity in the informal sector and enhance worker employability, overall. SEPA will also collaborate with ECAD and ECGF on institutional and public workforce capacity building in partnership with higher learning institutions. 4.21 Social Inclusion: The lack of access to quality skills among the youth from poor households and rural areas, and among persons with disability (PWDs), deepens their marginalisation. This excludes them from opportunities for upward social mobility, career development, and escaping from poverty. SEPA will support skills-development initiatives that promote social cohesion, peace building, and inclusion of the marginalised, including PWDs. SEPA will consider the needs of young internally displaced persons (IDPs), ex-combatants, and returnees in skills development. These objectives will be achieved, among other things, through reforms and targeted interventions, such as expanding Open Distance and eLearning (ODeL) systems. 4.22 Knowledge Generation: Knowledge generation and effective dissemination will be an important non-lending instrument of SEPA. Each area of intervention will be a source of quality information to generate knowledge products (Economic Sector Work, diagnostics, flagship reports etc.) on key issues related to skills development in Africa. The Bank will use its convening power to disseminate knowledge products to policy makers, DPs, and investors through seminars, forums, training events, and knowledge-outreach activities. The knowledge products will underpin policy dialogue and advisory services on skills development to RMCs. 18\n\nThus, in the context of SEPA, the Bank will seek to become more prominent as a knowledge provider on skills development. 5. IMPLEMENTING THE SEPA ACTION PLAN\n\nOperational Arrangements\n\nThe implementation of SEPA will adopt a demand-driven and differentiated 5.1 approach based on country context. For example, in Middle Income Countries (MICs), the provision of knowledge products and advisory services is becoming increasingly important. In such countries, the focus of SEPA will be on soft issues, in addition to the development of STEM in HE and TVET, digital technology and online learning infrastructure. In transitional states, conflicts have contributed to the destruction of public infrastructure, including skills- development facilities, while constraining public administration and service delivery. In such contexts, SEPA will, in partnership with higher learning institutions and in collaboration with ECAD, also focus on rebuilding the workforce with the necessary qualifications and relevant skills for public administration and service delivery. 5.2 Operations under SEPA will be designed and implemented in full compliance with the Bank’s operations cycle and standard operating procedures. Given the complementarity between SEPA and other strategies under the High 5s to address specific skills gaps in the relevant sectors of the Bank’s operations (paragraphs 3.6 and 4.5 above), the Human Capital, Youth and Skills Development Department (AHHD) will lead and co-ordinate with other departments and organisational units towards the implementation of SEPA under the “One Bank” approach. SEPA will facilitate the development of tools for integrating skills into the Bank’s operations. Different Departments and Divisions will participate in project design and implementation, as well as monitoring and follow- up through supervision missions, to identify potential early warning signals on emerging portfolio management issues. The implementation of SEPA rests with existing units within AHHD, with direct oversight by the Education and Skills Development Division (AHHD.1) in close relation with the Jobs Team. 5.3 AHHD.1 will facilitate: (i) linking SEPA with the High 5s to ensure the effective integration of skills development in both sovereign and non-sovereign operations with priority to sectors with high job-creation potential such as the agriculture value chain, transport, energy, ICT, and water; (ii) strengthening a “One Bank” approach in the implementation of the operations supported by SEPA; and (iii) promoting strong partnerships with UN agencies and CSOs for capacity building and implementation of activities, especially in transitional states. On the side of the RMCs, the central Ministry of Finance (or Planning depending on the country) will be the key counterpart of the Bank, but relevant sector ministries, sub-national authorities, and the private sector will share the responsibility for project identification, preparation, and implementation. Human and Financial Resources\n\nThe effective implementation of SEPA requires adequate human and financial 5.4 resources. The focus on TVET, STEM, ICT, and entrepreneurship skills will increase demand for the Bank’s technical assistance and advisory services. The Bank will assess its human resource gaps and identify areas with limited experience. To address gaps, some staff will be upgraded or retrained. In fields where it is not feasible to develop internal staff expertise, the Bank will consider engaging external expert organisations and individuals for support. In these\n\n19\n\nnew priority areas, the Bank will need flexibility, innovative implementation modalities, and rely on collaboration with other DPs and the private sector. The Bank’s administrative budget will cover some of the expenditure related to internal processes for the implementation of SEPA. The costs of SEPA-designated operations will follow the Bank’s applicable funding policies and procedures. Financing SEPA, from approval to completion in 2025, will amount to some UA550 million3 based on historical performance, the Bank’s commitments, and AHHD’s proposed Indicative Operational Programme (IOP). This sum includes funding the operations cycle, contributions to project funding, and contingencies. Up to 25% of the financing could also be mobilised through co-financing. Internal and External Communication\n\n5.5 A SEPA communication plan will be developed to ensure improved dialogue with RMCs, RECs, private sector partners, and key stakeholders at the country and sub-regional levels to include and prioritise skills development in Country Strategy Papers (CSPs) and Regional Integration Strategy Papers (RISPs). The implementation of SEPA will require effective communication with a clear action plan that selectively fosters the integration of skills across the Bank’s interventions. The Bank will continue to build effective communication in skills development on the continent, while strengthening partnerships with the AU, RECs, UN agencies, and other organisations, such as WorldSkills, that are dedicated to showcasing the value of skills, raising the profile of skilled professionals, and demonstrating the importance of skills in economic growth. Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E)\n\nimplementation will be monitored and evaluated based on the 5.6 workstream/activities described in the SEPA Implementation Action Matrix (IAM), the conceptual framework of ToC, and a Results Framework (RF) (Figure 4, Annexes I and II). These instruments offer a robust implementation plan and M&E framework that clearly describe the expected impact (goals) of SEPA, short- and medium-term outcomes, outputs, and key indicators with their logical connections. Getting accurate and timely data on skills development proved to be a challenge under the Bank’s Human Capital Strategy (HCS) that SEPA succeeds, so SEPA operations will include concrete measures to build human and institutional capacity in RMCs for data collection, analysis, management, and a comprehensive results-measurement framework. The Delivery Performance Management and Results (SNDR) and IT (CHIS) Departments of the Bank will design a tool (in essence, a Skill for Productive Jobs Dashboard) for integrating skills and jobs in Bank operations in line with ADF–15 commitment, for the monitoring of performance indicators. SEPA will leverage the Joint Impact Model under JfYA and the Employment Dashboard under Enable Youth to measure direct, indirect, and induced jobs. This integrated skills and job marker will be included in the Dashboard. SEPA will also utilise results from joint-portfolio performance reviews, conducted by the Bank and RMCs, and the Mid-Term Review of the JfYA by BDEV. A mid-term review of SEPA will be conducted in 2024 and a full review at completion in 2025. SEPA\n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures\n\n5.7 Table 5, together with mitigation measures.

SEPA provides the Bank with a tool to deepen and broaden its engagement in skills development under JfYA for 2022 to 2025. SEPA aligns with the development priorities of RMCs alongside the Bank’s commitments and its development agenda. Drawing on the lessons of past strategies in education and skills development, and with AfDB’s comparative advantage in the sector, SEPA will enable the Bank to consolidate its past achievements in supporting skills development for inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction in Africa. For maximum effectiveness, and based on rational selectivity, SEPA focuses on skills development in STEM in Higher Education, TVET, and digital and online learning infrastructure to promote a productive, innovative and, above all, an employable labour force. 21\n\nANNEX I: SEPA 2022–2025 RESULTS FRAMEWORK\n\nSKILLS FOR EMPLOYMENT AND PRODUCTIVITY IN AFRICA (SEPA) ACTION PLAN 2022–2025\n\nRESULTS CHAIN AND INDICATOR DESCRIPTION\n\nUNIT OF MEASUREMENT\n\nBASELINE (2018–2022)\n\nTARGET (2025)\n\nMEANS OF VERIFICATION\n\nFREQUENCY OF DATA COLLECTION\n\nA.

JfYA is being implemented through three strategic interventions areas: Integration, Innovation, and Investment to increase inclusive employment and entrepreneurship, strengthen human capital, and create durable labour markets."
    ],
    [
        "To reinforce the implementation of JfYA, and following the expiry of the Human Capital Strategy (HCS) in February 2021, SEPA is designed to scale up the skills aspect of JfYA, particularly the flagship programmes in agriculture, industry and ICT focused on developing young entrepreneurs and enhancing the skills of youth to meet private sector needs, fostering improved pathways to productive employment. III.2 Building on the JfYA strategic goal of equipping youth with skills, SEPA establishes the Bank’s framework for targeted investments to build skills that promote youth employability, labour productivity and gender equality. SEPA will expand STEM in HE and TVET, digital technology beyond coding, and online learning skills infrastructure, while supporting an environment that develops skills directly linked to jobs and youth entrepreneurship. It will also address the issue of obsolete skills in the adult working population due to transformation of the labour market towards digital and technical skills, and STEM- related competencies. III.3 Preliminary assessment in the mid-term review (MTR) of JfYA conducted in 2021 showed progress towards achieving the overall goal of the strategy. Between 2016 and 2019, the Bank supported the creation of 8.5 million direct and indirect jobs (Table A–III.1). In 2020, 49% of all Bank-approved projects for ADF–15 countries included jobs and skills for youth (ADF–15 Commitments Report). As a mitigation measure to counter the impact of COVID–19 and reduce job losses, the Bank included business support and economic resilience components in all its COVID–19 Response Facility (CRF) operations to save and create more jobs. The Bank also included a social protection component, particularly for workers in the informal economy, the majority of whom are young people and women. For example, in 2020, the Bank’s Business protection outcomes benefited more than 240,000 SMEs (RDVP CRF Q3 Progress Report). III.4 Equipping 50 million youths with relevant skills goes beyond technical skills and includes ensuring they also acquire soft skills. The Coding for Employment (CfE) flagship programme has equipped over 80,000 youths from 45 countries with digital skills and relevant soft skills that go beyond the ICT sector. ENABLE Youth in Agribusiness has operationalised $406 million of projects in 14 countries, benefiting 23,000 young people and creating 58,000 jobs. The $40 million Youth Entrepreneurship and Innovation Multi-Donor Trust (YEI MDTF) is underpinning enterprise-support organisations — such as financial institutions, incubators and other agencies — that help youth-led start-ups and small and medium enterprises to thrive. For example, the Bank Trust Fund supported the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF), providing 10,000 youth entrepreneurs with technical assistance and mentorship life-cycle support they need to succeed. To date, the TEF Entrepreneurship Programme has funded and mentored over 9,000 young entrepreneurs, in under 7 years.

The Bank recognises that market failures and lack of access to finance prevent young entrepreneurs from reaching their full potential. With Youth Entrepreneurship Investment Banks (YEIBs), the Bank seeks to support RMCs in addressing these failures through the provision of financial and non-financial instruments, as well as services to reduce risk for youth entrepreneurs. The Bank is seeking investors and advisors who will share its vision of ensuring that market failures hindering the ability of youth-led businesses to grow and create jobs are addressed. III.6 Lessons learned in implementing the JfYA Strategy. The implementation of the Strategy so far has provided a number of lessons, informing the development of SEPA and subsequent implementation. One important lesson learned is that dedicated resources, including funding, need to be secured to be able fully to implement commitments under SEPA. This will require intensifying dialogue within the Bank and at the country level to generate interest and focus, as well as to obtain resouce allocations from Bank investment instruments. Another lesson learned is the need to establish a management-information system that tracks and reports results regarding achievement of SEPA’s Key Performance Indicators to enable continuous learning and subsequent evaluation. There is also the need to ensure close alignment of SEPA indicators with the RF, which will report on corporate operational achievements and ensure high-level institutional visibility. It will also be crucial to ensure capacity building among operational staff across other sectors for increased mainstreaming and development impact on skills."

        "III. 7 Under JfYA, the Bank is promoting the Skills Enhancement Zones (SEZ) approach, which aims to address the low productivity and competitiveness of the continent’s workforce, a critical obstacle to Africa’s industrialisation. The SEZ is a two- pronged approach designed to: (i) build a relevant technical and vocational skilled workforce aligned to employer needs for a particular industrial cluster or sector (agriculture, ICT, etc), through demand-driven training and job placement interventions within that industrial cluster; and (ii) support potential entrepreneurs to take up business opportunities along the value chains linked to that particular industrial cluster and scale up their businesses, take advantage of local content opportunities, and boost youth employment. III.8 A key aspect of the SEZ approach is to offer a rapid response to on-demand skills by industry through short-term training programmes. It promotes training within and/or around industrial parks to enhance on-the-job training. Under SEPA, SEZs will be expanded. Initially, the approach has been limited to selected industrial parks managed by government agencies. N\n\nThe SEZ approach is an integral part of the Bank’s Special Agro-industrial III. 9 Processing Zones Programme (SAPZ). Pilot operations in Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, and Guinea benefit from direct Bank investment in ongoing SAPZ programmes amounting to $238.37 million (July 2021) and leveraging $159.81 million in co-financing. SEZ primarily targets middle-income countries where industrial sectors are established with at least an industrial park. SEPA will support the scale-up and adoption of the SEZ approach to other industrial clusters that have been already prioritised in the Bank’s Industrialisation Strategy 2016–2025. These include: (i) sectors aiming at expanding domestic processing (building materials, textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals etc); (ii) natural resources (energy, mining, metallurgy); (iii) service (logistics, ICT); and (iv) supporting integration into international value chains (electronics, automotive) depending on the country context. These are the sectors that have the potential for moving the African industrial landscape from low-value, primary, unprocessed commodities to diversified value addition, job creation, and technology transfer. SEPA provides opportunities to extend the model to other RMCs, including in fragile contexts, that aim to pursue value-chain development but lack a skilled labour force. The SEZ approach is designed to equip the youth with the rapid acquisition of industry-sought skills, complementing traditional long-term career skills training. O\n\nANNEX IV: INCORPORATION OF LESSONS LEARNED FOR THE FORMULATION OF SEPA\n\nLessons The human capital needs of RMCs are huge and evolving and will continue to increase, thus providing opportunities for continued investment in demand-driven education and skills-development and projects. To address all the needs, the Bank should work in partnership with other stakeholders, including the private sector. The review of the Bank’s Medium-Term Strategy 2008–2012 and the 2011 Medium Term Review of HEST stresses the need for the Bank to maintain science and technology as a strategic focus area and the need to scale up STI and link HE and TVET to productive sectors. More skills-development ecosystems are needed to ensure private- sector engagement in education and training systems to mitigate shocks and fragility, improve relevance, promote research, and enhance private financing. The COVID–19 pandemic has highlighted the need for the Bank to mobilise more co- financing to meet the demand from its RMCs adequately, invest in digital skills and support skills-development systems that are resilient to shocks and fragility. Close attention should be paid to staffing and the smart managing of talent and expertise with a focus on recruiting staff such as sector economists, architects, and IT specialists, and establishing a plan to attract and retain experts to improve the performance of AHHD. The success of SEPA hinges on forging strategic partnerships and rebuilding policy- the dialogue capacity as contributions of the on-going partnerships in delivering the Bank’s human-capital agenda. A robust monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework is necessary to measure results risk impact effectively. Effective and mitigation for tools are also needed successful implementation of the future Action Plan. programmes\n\nrelevant\n\nshown by\n\nImplications for SEPA formulation SEPA provides a framework for continued investment for employability with the involvement of other funding sources, including the private sector, to close the financing gap. in\n\nskills development\n\nHE and TVET are Areas of Intervention of SEPA given that they remain relevant and for critical industrialisation and manufacturing/value addition. in\n\nrelation\n\nto\n\nskills\n\nSEPA will help build more relevant skills- development ecosystems by promoting national frameworks that ensure private sector engagement in education and training systems. SEPA calls for more investment in digital skills, and resilient skills development systems. A sub-pillar is devoted to digital infrastructure and digital skills. SEPA takes stock of the available AHHD staff of 38 experts and envisions filling its current vacancies. Under SEPA, the Bank will keep and strengthen in supporting skills development and build new partnerships. Building partnerships is a sub- pillar of SEPA. include Operations under SEPA will concrete measures to provide resources and build human and institutional capacity in RMCs for M&E data collection, analysis, and management. SEPA will enhance the alignment of SEPA indicators with the RF, which reports on corporate operational\n\non-going\n\npartnerships\n\nP\n\nThere is a need to spur innovation in operation delivery and foster internal cross- sectorial collaboration for better integration of skills development in productive sectors such as agriculture, energy, water, transport, and other sectors. It is essential to ensure timely allocation of budget to meet requirements in terms of quality resources human operation designs sector dialogue.

SEPA is a Bank-wide Action Plan anchored to the JfYA Strategy and aligned with the Bank’s High 5 priority areas with a focus on skills development in TVET and STEM that enhance employability in all these sectors. Through SEPA, capacity building of operational staff across other sectors for increased mainstreaming and development impact on skills will be enhanced. Adequate resources will be budgeted for the effective implementation of SEPA. to\n\nensure\n\nand\n\nresults\n\nreport\n\nlearning\n\nand\n\nUnder SEPA, operations will systematically include private-sector participation in skills development in all relevant areas. Q\n\nANNEX V: CONSULTATIONS TO INFORM THE SEPA ACTION PLAN\n\nThe SEPA Action Plan was prepared through a highly participatory approach guided internally by the “One Bank” approach that brought together a wide array of the Bank’s Units, experts, and management. The Bank also consulted externally, guided by the principle of collaboration and partnerships with the private sector, other DPs, UN agencies, reputable academic and research institutions, and civil society organisations. Throughout the process of formulation, SEPA benefited from reviews and inputs from internal and external consultations. Internally, a cross-Department Taskforce was set up to carry out the technical tasks of formulating the SEPA Action Plan. A cross-Complex Committee, involving the Directors4 of the Taskforce members as the Steering Committee, guided the preparation of the Action Plan. This approach ensured the alignment of the Action Plan with other Bank policies and strategies and helped to secure buy-in from other Complexes. Following the clearance of the draft SEPA Action Plan for consultations, internal meetings were organised to reinforce Bank-wide ownership of SEPA and discuss opportunities for collaboration among Departments for its implementation. These meetings were conducted in the form of webinars via Zoom online meetings with three groups as follows:\n\nDate 30 November 2021 16 February 2022 21 February 2022\n\nMeeting\n\nConsultation with SEPA IDWG Team\n\nConsultation with AHHD\n\nConsultation with Regions\n\nAudience\n\nInternal\n\nInternal\n\nInternal\n\nStakeholders\n\nBank’s AfDB Experts and Managers Bank’s AHHD Managers and Directors Bank’s Regional DGs, Managers and Experts\n\nPreliminary external consultations were conducted through the knowledge work and studies that were carried out to inform the formulation of the SEPA Action Plan. The Bank commissioned four analytical notes to inform SEPA: (i) an Analytical Note on TVET; (ii) Higher Education, Science, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation; (iii) Mapping of DP interventions in RMCs; and (iv) Review of previous Bank interventions between 2014 and 2020. Processing the analytical work involved consultation and engagement with various skills-development stakeholders in public and private sectors, and from CSOs, who provided valuable information and advice on the key issues. Their feedback further enriched the focus of the Action Plan. The reports from these studies were part of the sources of information and data that informed the formulation of the Action Plan. Following the completion of final consultations with the Bank’s internal stakeholders, external consultation meetings were organised with the Bank’s strategic partners to enhance ownership and relevance of SEPA and establish dialogue towards identifying opportunities for collaboration with these partners. These meetings were conducted in the form of webinars via Zoom online meetings with five groups of external stakeholders as follows:\n\n4 AHAI, AHGC, AHHD, AHWS, BDEV, ECMR, ECST, PECG, PERN, PESD, PIFD, PITD, RDRI , RDTS, SNOQ, and SNSP.

They further helped to identify the overarching problems, key constraints, assumptions, and linkages among the various levels of the Theory of Change (ToC), a key conceptual framework for the SEPA Action Plan. The main outcome of the consultations was a clear validation by all stakeholders of the timeliness and relevance of SEPA. Participants to the consultation meetings hailed SEPA as a most welcome, coherent, and critical intervention in skills development with ambitious and well-targeted plans that are very promising for the continent. They underlined the importance of the fact that SEPA is well anchored in the Bank’s strategic priorities, the national development plans of African countries, the AU's Agenda 2063 aspirations, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They provided valuable suggestions that would enhance the success of SEPA implementation. Once finalised and approved, the SEPA Action Plan will be posted on the Bank’s external website in conformity with the Bank Group’s Policy on Disclosure and Access to Information (DAI).

        "Entrepreneurship/Entrepreneurial skills are a combination of hard skills (technical and financial skills) and soft skills that include leadership, creativity, innovation, risk-taking and business management competences necessary to successfully run a business or a project, leading to self-employment and job creation. Fab lab and maker spaces refer to a space with a set of digital fabrication machines for invention, innovation, and entrepreneurship with a unique operation. The term is widely used by academia and DFIs. These digital fabrication spaces have the potential to transform service delivery, develop local industry, boost entrepreneurship, provide hands-on learning experience, and increase interest in STEM educationxxxi. The “Fourth Industrial Revolution” (4IR) describes a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres. It highlights the positive relationship between higher education, STI, R&D and sustainable development through private and public channels. Three key elements 4IR are: (i) the development of digital skills is paramount; (ii) all industries are being digitally disrupted, presenting an opportunity for growing a new knowledge economy; and (iii) government and the private sector must collaborate, perhaps via PPPs, which are powerful levers for change. See the Bank’s analytical work on the status of science, technology and innovation (STI) in Africa prepared in 2018 (AfDB, 2018c). Fragility: Defined by the Bank as, “A condition where the exposure to internal or external pressures exceeds existing capacities to prevent, respond to, and recover from them, creating risks of instability.”\n\nHigher education comprises all post-secondary education, training, and research guidance at tertiary institutions such as universities. It provides learning activities in specialised fields and aims at learning at a high level of complexity and specialisation. Higher education includes what is commonly understood as “academic” education but also refers to advanced vocational or professional education, including teacher-training schools (for secondary school teachers). Productive employment is broadly defined as a job that creates value addition that can be exchanged for capital, but it can also mean employment yielding sufficient returns to labour to permit the worker and her/his dependents a level of consumption above the poverty line. (ILO, 2012). V\n\nSkills refers to the ability to perform duties and responsibilities effectively and efficiently within the time allotted. It can also refer to the ability to perform an action with determined results often within a given amount of time, energy, or both. Skills can be domain-general or domain-specific and include cognitive and socio-emotional skills. Cognitive skills include literacy and numeracy, which endow the ability to understand complex ideas, adapt effectively to the environment, learn from experience, and reason. Socio-emotional skills refer to the ability to navigate interpersonal and social situations effectively and include leadership, teamwork, self-control, and courage. Specific or technical skills refer to the acquired knowledge, expertise, and interactions needed to perform a specific job, including the mastery of materials, tools, or technologies. The acquisition of practical competencies, know-how, and attitudes are necessary to perform a particular trade or occupation in the labour market. Skills-development infrastructure. In this document, “Skills Infrastructure” refers to both physical (hard) and soft infrastructure. Physical infrastructure includes the construction, expansion, rehabilitation, and equipment for TVET, STEM and entrepreneurship-related infrastructure, including classrooms, laboratories, lecture spaces, workshops, incubators, libraries, research labs, e-learning centres, and ICT equipment for online learning, among others. Soft infrastructure refers to services that are required to ensure high-performing hard infrastructure that delivers accessibility, efficiency, relevance, resilience and sustainability. These include issues such as curriculum, teachers, governance arrangements and M&E systems, etc. Skills Enhancement Zones constitute a skills-development approach under the JfYA Strategy that aims to develop a skilled workforce aligned to employer needs by creating demand-led training and job-placement programmes within industrial clusters. The approach is based upon the proven success of the dual vocational education and training (VET) approach to skills development, linking theoretical and practical training and reinforcing close collaboration between educators and employers to ensure that the acquired skills meet the needs of employers. Technical and vocational education and training (TVET) refers to a broad range of preparation at different levels of the education and training system. o “Technical” refers to occupations in the technician category that are usually\n\nprepared at the post-secondary level. o “Vocational” refers to middle-level, or traditional trade occupations for semi-skilled\n\nand skilled workers. o “Vocational and technical education” refers to exposure to the world of work, and\n\nto preparation for entry into further vocational and technical studies. o Technical and vocational “training” means preparation for direct entry into, or\n\nupgrading in, specific (or clusters of) occupations in the labour market. The Triple Helix Model of innovation refers to a set of interactions between academia (the university), industry, and government, to foster economic and social development, as described in concepts such as the knowledge economy and knowledge society.

With more than 100 countries having pledged a shift to renewable energy and net zero emissions by 2050, investments in low carbon technology outpaced investments into fossil fuels for the first time 2023."

        "Driven by strong industrial policies around the world, renewable energy investments are set to reach $1.7 trillion, overtaking the $1 trillion in unabated fossil fuels (IEA 2023). This report sets out the employment and socio-economic impacts of national and global climate policies in the MENA region. Four main findings are drawn. First, in a global net zero emissions scenario where countries in the MENA region remain passive by-standers in the energy transition, they may face welfare losses. Under such scenario countries implement the declared Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) but fall short of climate neutrality. The effect on jobs is negligible but GDP by 2050 is projected to be 2.2% lower relative to a current policy baseline scenario. Second, however, in a scenario in which MENA countries actively drive the global energy transition, significant gains in jobs and GDP may be achieved. Such scenario implies strong industrial and just transition policies in addition to enhanced climate policies. Industrial policies are in the field of green hydrogen, solar power and electric mobility, combined with Just Transition policies to enable up- and reskilling and skills training for young people in new low-carbon technologies. Social Protection and relocation programs are required for fossil fuel workers. In this scenario, employment and GDP levels are 3.5% and 4.8% higher than baseline, respectively. A net total of 6.6 million jobs are created in MENA. Third, if in addition to strong industrial policies, MENA countries link climate to development policies and further invest into climate resilience, green water desalination, reforestation and waste management, GDP would accelerate to 7.2 % and employment to 5.3% above baseline by 2050. Such a resilience scenario also relies on strong just transition policies targeting investment in human capital, social protection and unskilled and low-income workers. This translates into just under 10 million new jobs across economic sectors created in MENA. Fourth, employment and socio-economic impacts vary across MENA countries and sectors. Countries with a high dependency on oil and gas would be the biggest winners in a strong industrial policy scenario, but - in the absence of enhanced industrial, climate and just transition policies - also the most negatively impacted in terms of GDP and job losses. Job gains in a strong industrial policy scenario are largest in the construction and green hydrogen sectors, with some 2.8 and 1.9 million jobs created respectively, followed by motor vehicle manufacturing (1.5 million jobs) and electric engineering (900,000 jobs). Jobs losses would hit sectors in Oil and Gas/Fuel supply and Plastics industry most, with each sector requiring support to some 700,000 and 460,000 jobs respectively to reskill and transition into other occupations. From the above results following the policy conclusions are sketched. In the unfolding global energy transition MENA could become a new leader. With strong industrial and just transition policies in place, significant welfare gains could be achieved as compared to a business-as-usual scenario. MENA has the potential to catch up in the energy transition and pull alongside currently leading countries who are harnessing first mover advantages, clean-tech monopolies, export markets and some 13.7 million renewable energy jobs created globally. With their comparative advantage and expertise in fossil fuel energy technology, abundant renewable resources and youthful labour market,\n\n6\n\ncountries in the MENA region have the potential to replicate and enact best practice green industrial and just transition policies. This would require a shift in gear. A combination of strong industrial and climate policies matched with Just Transition policies are key to enable positive economic and labour market outcomes. The reskilling of fossil fuel workers and their social protection to ensure frictionless industrial restructuring is a precondition. Technical and vocational education and skills training for the young matched with investments into eco-innovation, incubation and green entrepreneurship would enable the restructuring and create a vibrant private sector. Skills gaps may emerge as the MENA region is currently dominated by medium- and low skilled migrant workers. In a low-carbon transition national and migrant workers need technical and vocational training and reskilling as technologies continue to evolve and new industries which did not exist before emerge in the region. There are likely growing demands for highly skilled workers. All displaced workers in fossil fuel extraction industries, 10% of the remaining workforce in other sectors and 20% of youth are assumed to receive training. This is equivalent to a minimum of 16 million trainees in the ambitious net zero scenarios by 2050 (including 300 thousand fossil fuel workers, 7.9 million workers in other sectors and 8 million young people). Importantly, significantly higher demands for labour mean increased opportunities for all, including marginalized groups with impacts on the distribution of jobs across sectors, age, gender and citizenship. To address potential mismatches and ensure a frictionless restructuring, targeted active labour market policies are required. They could address the region’s high levels of youth unemployment, and low levels of economic participation among women. As a result, potential wage increases will improve pay for existing workers and create incentives for inactive working-age population to join the workforce. This will need to be supported by investment in training as well as additional social protection and active labour market policies. Financing is crucial as higher productivity levels in 2050 can only be achieved with productive investments into human and clean-tech capital such as modelled in the strong industrial policy scenario. Net capital investment requirements for MENA in cumulative terms over the 2023-50 period are estimated at $10 trillion in the most ambitious net zero scenario, not including other policy costs that also require financing such as training and lost oil royalties. Domestic and international options include fiscally neutral and progressive energy tax and subsidy reforms, royalties from green hydrogen and clean energy exports, sovereign wealth funds’ investments into green funds and bonds and redirection of investments from oil and gas into clean tech. 7\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.1\n\nBackground\n\nThe Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is a critical source of global resources due to its vast abundance of oil and gas reserves. This makes the region a key building block of the global transition towards a low-carbon economy and fulfilling the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature change to below 1.5°C by the end of the century. Several countries of the region have already committed to being net-zero by 2050, such as United Arab Emirates and Oman, with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain committing to net zero by 2060. The vast majority of other countries, which have not yet committed fully to reaching net-zero, had set NDC targets to reduce carbon emissions by 2030. There are several factors that are important to reaching the decarbonization targets that have been proposed. On the one hand, managing and setting the portfolio of the energy sector is a major issue. The countries that are part of the Gulf Cooperation Council in particular would need to diversify their energy sectors which are heavily dependent on oil production. On the other hand, to ensure a sustainable economic growth trajectory, industrial policies need to be implemented to complement energy sector policies. They would facilitate the process of economic reform and help offset potential losses linked to reduced global demand for oil and gas (which traditionally has been a critical source of income for the MENA economy). With the backdrop of recent events, including Covid-19 and the Ukraine war which have created disruptions across the world, it is also increasingly important for countries in the region to develop a socio-economic strategy that improves social welfare and equity for their population, especially minorities and special groups of the labour force. With a diverse and growing workforce, provision of training and support to help prepare workers for the challenges and opportunities of the transition will be a key priority for the governments. The United Arab Emirates represents the region to host the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) this year and is facilitating international dialogues to develop towards a more sustainable and resilient global economy. This presents an opportunity for local policymakers to strengthen progress on climate action, map economic and social strategies, as well as to enhance cross-region collaboration in delivering its unique goals and ambitions. 1.2\n\nObjectives\n\nThis report provides economic analysis to support the International Labour Organization (ILO) in providing policy guidance and recommendations to the MENA region on the net zero transition. The analysis has the following main objectives:\n\nAssess the economic and particularly jobs implications of different scenarios of the energy transition in the MENA region. Simulate different ‘what-if’ scenarios to indicate the range of possibilities and outcomes, particularly in envisioning a clean energy and green industrial growth trajectory to offset potential losses in oil and gas. Provide insights into cross-sector and cross-country dynamics that have significant policy implications. Highlight the potential role of policies that do not directly affect the energy system but are critical in supporting the transition, covering several elements of a ‘just’ transition. 8\n\nThis report focuses on the MENA economy as a whole, which is defined by the ILO as consisting of 22 countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Occupied Palestinian Authority, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arabs Emirates (UAE), and Yemen. Additional highlights of impacts are provided on the Arab States aggregate (consisting of 12 of the 22 MENA countries, as defined by the ILO1), as well as the economies of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Algeria and Libya. 1.3\n\nReport structure\n\nThe rest of the report consists of three chapters describing the methodology, findings and key policy conclusions, supplemented by technical appendices. Chapter 2 outlines the approach to the analysis, including the modelling framework, scenario narratives and assumptions. Chapter 3 discusses the results in detail, covering the environmental and GDP impacts of the different scenarios considered in aggregate terms and detailed discussions of sectoral jobs implications for the MENA region. Chapter 4 summarizes the main conclusions and highlights policy implications from the scenario results. Detailed policy assumptions and results are provided in the appendices, together with a detailed description of the modelling methodology. 1 Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Occupied Palestinian Authority, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, UAE and\n\nYemen. 9\n\nMacroeconom ic modelling\n\n2 Methodology\n\n2.1 Modelling framework\n\nThe modelling analysis is undertaken using a hybrid approach, combining simulations with Cambridge Econometrics’ global macroeconomic model E3ME and linked off-model\n\nanalyses to derive additional details that span outside the scope of the model. E3ME is a macroeconomic model of the world’s economic and energy systems and the environment. It is widely used across the world for policy assessment and scenario analysis, particularly on the impacts of environmental and climate mitigation policy on\n\nthe economy and the labour market. E3ME allows for detailed analysis of the impact of policies and scenarios across various technologies, fuel types, and economic activities. The model accounts for 71 regions, covering the whole globe and individually modelling all G20 and major world economies. The countries that are not individually modelled are grouped in aggregate regions. More detailed information can be found in the 1.11.1.1.1.Appendix A, moreover a technical model manual of E3ME is available online at www.e3me.com. The regional coverage of the model is constrained by model classifications. Out of the 22 MENA countries, only a proportion is explicitly represented as single economies in E3ME. This is due to constraints on data availability and quality, as the approach undertaken in E3ME relies heavily on historical data to populate model parameters (which capture behavioural responses). To complement the modelling exercise, an off-model estimation process is therefore carried out to align the results from E3ME (covering a majority subset of MENA countries) to the full definition of the MENA region. There are five E3ME regions that explicitly map to countries in the MENA region (which will be referred to in the rest of the report as “native MENA regions”). For these E3ME regions, the model has a representation for 44 industrial sectors (based on the NACE Rev. 2 classifications, of which ISIC Rev.4 is an international equivalent). The final list of countries included in the modelling, and in the final MENA and Arabs aggregates, is included in Table 1.

The calculations involve:\n\nTaking historical data (external to the model) on GDP, total employment, and employment by sector to estimate the proportion of the MENA region or the Arab States that is represented by the sum of countries modelled explicitly in E3ME (Algeria, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Egypt and UAE). For GDP and employment, assuming this proportion is fixed between scenarios and over the modelled period and applying it to the E3ME results to estimate the MENA/Arab States totals. Total output is estimated in a similar way as GDP (from regional proportions of GDP) and then disaggregated by sector based on the sectoral distribution of employment. This approach assumes that the countries modelled explicitly in E3ME are a fair representation of decarbonization targets and expected transition responses across the MENA region as a whole. The external data to conduct the off-model calculations are as follows:\n\nGDP data are sourced from the World Bank and shares are calculated for the most recent year in which data are available for all MENA countries (2021). Total employment and employment by sector are sourced from the Internal Labour Organization’s Labour Force Statistics (LFS) and Modelled Estimates. Similar to GDP, the most recent year of data for all MENA countries (2021) is used for the evaluation of shares. For countries which are not available from the LFS dataset for the latest year of history (2021), the Modelled Estimates data (by aggregate sector) are used to adjust the LFS data (by detailed sector) for the most recent year. Sectoral employment data are extracted according to ISIC 4 and ISIC 3 classifications. The broader sectoral classifications are used when ILO sector classifications consist of multiple E3ME sectors. The data take into account paid employment (whether at work or with a job but not at work) and self-employment (whether at work or with an enterprise but not at work). The analysis aims to capture the following impacts by comparing policy scenarios with the reference baseline:\n\neconomic impacts from economy-wide and sector-specific decarbonization policies (through energy system feedbacks), as well as from direct investment stimuli and financing assumptions Direct\n\n\n\nIndirect economic impacts across sectors through supply chain linkages\n\n11\n\n\n\nInduced economic impacts from household income and consumption being affected by direct and indirect impacts\n\nDirect impacts from decarbonization policies and NDCs, combining social, economic and environmental goals and policies together, are considered as part of the modelled scenarios. The analysis excludes non-CO2 emissions, climate risks and co-benefits. 2.2\n\nScenario design\n\nThe modelling analysis assesses four different policy scenarios, developed in collaboration with the ILO. The scenarios were designed to answer the following questions:\n\n\n\nIn which part of the economy (which sector) and to what extent are jobs opportunities and jobs losses likely present as a result of the transition? How do these impacts vary according to the level of ambition or the policy package employed? Will the opportunities outweigh the losses, if so, to what extent and through which channels? What are policy implications for the labour market as a whole and specific groups of workers? The narrative for each scenario is the following:\n\n1 Current policies – This scenario incorporates policies implemented in the MENA\n\ncountries up to the end of 2022. It is achieved by calibrating the E3ME baseline to external projections that include those policies (according to the IEA World Energy Outlook 2022’s Stated Policies scenario). This scenario also includes observed historical impacts and assumptions for recent events including Covid-19 and high energy prices as a result of the Ukraine war. Minor adjustments are made, in addition to the above, to incorporate impacts of new hydrogen facilities opened recently in the region, as domestic hydrogen production capacity is not accounted for in published datasets. 2 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) – This scenario assumes countries in the MENA region deliver their unconditional NDC targets by 2030 (or conditional targets where no unconditional targets are announced, as in the case of Egypt). This is achieved by implementing policies included in NDC documents into E3ME in the first instance; however, if policy details are not sufficiently provided in the NDC documents, a package of standard E3ME policies are used to mimic the same level of efforts. If policy choices require to be defined outside of available documents, the following policies are combined due to them being already widely deployed as decarbonization measures across other parts of the world: carbon pricing in energy- intensive industries, fossil fuel phase-out and renewable subsidies in the power sector and economy-wide energy efficiency investment. All policies are assumed to continue having an effect after 2030, although no new policy will be introduced after that point. In some regions, this means there will be continued effort towards long-term net-zero emissions targets beyond 2030 if applicable, but such net-zero targets are not achieved. If only conditional targets are announced, international support is assumed (without specifying the source) to help fund policy costs according to the amount of support required as stated in policy documents. 12\n\n3 Strong Industrial Policy – This scenario sees the region deliver net zero emissions by 2050 by scaling up all policies in the NDC scenario and adding stronger measures to facilitate the transition across the region. Net zero emissions is defined in terms of CO2 emissions; thus the net zero emission year (2050) is when CO2 emissions is no longer positive. All countries in the region would have different paces of decarbonization, scaled up from their current NDC ambitions. This means some countries will achieve net zero emissions earlier than 2050, and some later. In order to achieve net zero emissions, all countries need to overshoot their NDC targets by 2030 and together implement stronger policies immediately. The full package of standard E3ME policy instruments are used to complement existing and NDC policies. These include phasing out fossil fuels in end-use sectors, expanding carbon pricing to all sectors of the economy, increasing innovation to deploy new low-carbon technologies to market (including carbon capture and storage, power grid management and storage solutions and domestic production of green hydrogen). In this scenario, the region aims to diversify and replace export revenues from oil and gas by low-carbon exports, including solar-based electricity, green hydrogen and electric vehicles. This goal relies on investment in the relevant industries to build domestic capacity, which supports additional investment in other sectors. In addition to the support for conditional NDC targets under the NDC scenario, the region will depend on international financing for some of the required investments and for addressing incidents of stranded assets. As such, it is assumed that this financing will be made available (without specifying exactly the sources) to assist MENA countries in:\n\nCompensating lost oil royalties and power sector profits from stranded assets (specifically local fossil fuel reserves and fossil fuel power plants that are forced by regulation to close before their end of life) Investing in reskilling and relocation programs (for fossil fuel supply workers who are likely displaced by the transition, for the workforce to adapt to new low- carbon technologies and practices, and for young people to participate effectively in the labour market)\n\n\n\nAll other policy costs and investments (which include renewable subsidies, investment in grid and storage, and green hydrogen production investment) are financed domestically by carbon revenues and other tax raising mechanisms (more detail included in section 2.3). 4 Climate Resilience – This scenario follows closely the Strong Industrial Policy scenario,\n\nwith the addition of policies to build a climate-resilient economy. Additional policies include:\n\nEnhanced waste management facilities to improve circular economy across all sectors\n\n\n\nIncreased recycling rates for plastics (thus reducing demand for virgin oil inputs)\n\nClimate adaptation measures including desalinating seawater and reforestation\n\nWaste management and recycling policies are financed domestically, in the same way as decarbonization policies in the Strong Industrial Policy scenario. To finance climate adaptation policies, a regional fund is established. This fund is funded partly by the international community and partly by the countries in the\n\n13\n\nregion themselves. The distribution of funding across MENA countries corresponds to their GDP per capita, whereas their share of benefits is determined by their level of climate vulnerability. 2.3 Model assumptions\n\nThe policy assumptions are inspired by existing policies, targets and pilot projections in the region. Currently, there is no region-wide target on climate action and other targets vary significantly across the region, with large economies being relatively more ambitious. Most quantified targets also only emphasize the decarbonization of the energy system, although some countries have started to explore other areas (e.g. social and industrial policies) and set up pilot projects or country-specific targets. While the majority of policies so far have been implemented at the national level, a few regional policies (e.g. the Middle East Green Initiative) have been set up to facilitate cross-country collaboration. for each of the MENA constituent 1.11.1.1.1.Appendix B countries/regions present in E3ME according to each country’s NDCs and other announcements. These targets cover a variety of indicators including emission reductions, energy mix and demand, adoption of electric vehicles, and waste management."

The model captures individual country dynamics as well as interactions with other regions of the global economy. A wide range of climate policy options are available including regulations, taxes, tariffs and subsidies, especially for the largest emitters in the economy (power, steel, road transport and residential buildings) which also feature a detailed representation of technology diffusion\n\nThe shift of focus away from determining a least-cost policy implementation and from towards decarbonization. On the other hand, there are a number of limitations to the analysis:\n\nAs with any modelling tool, E3ME is an imperfect representation of reality. Gaps in the data and an inability to predict the future both contribute to uncertainty in the model results. Given the diverse characteristics of the economy and energy system, it is not technically possible to account precisely for every possible energy source and technology in each sector. For example, the model accounts for seasonal variations, implied demand for backup generation and storage and technological constraints in the MENA context to determine the technology mix, but it does not fully capture detailed power grid balancing requirements (which can only be accounted for using real time hourly data). The analysis focuses on evaluating the socioeconomic impacts of increased climate action with some consideration for costs, savings and trade-offs. It does not quantify avoided climate-related physical damages (the cost of inaction) and co-benefits (from improved environmental outcomes), both of which would add more incentives to accelerate the low-carbon transition. The quality of the data used in the modelling is very important. Substantial resources are put into maintaining the E3ME database and filling out gaps in the data. However, particularly in countries such as the MENA countries, there is some uncertainty in results due to the data used. In addition, there is uncertainty about the target assumptions used in the scenarios, which are formed outside of the model based on the best available information in the public domain. The modelling results therefore are 15\n\nsimulation results to estimate the range of possible economic outcomes associated with modelled policies or changes in the economy, rather than forecasts of likely scenarios. 16\n\n3 Findings\n\n3.1\n\nProgress towards decarbonization targets\n\nIn the NDC scenario, total CO2 emissions for Algeria, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Egypt and UAE are expected to fall by 16% by 2030 relative to the Current Policies baseline (45% by 2050). There is a gradual uptake in renewables after 2030, but the region still has heavy reliance on oil and gas (with a small share of gas with CCS before 2030). Saudi Arabia drives renewables deployment in the region, followed by Egypt and UAE. In this scenario, targets for 2030 are largely met except:  Saudi Arabia falls short on emissions reductions and renewable targets (implying that\n\ncurrent targets may be more ambitious than implied by progress to date). UAE falls short on power and transport emissions targets but meets the renewable target. Similar to Saudi Arabia, this may be due to incompatibility between current targets and recent progress.

However, despite a much stronger phase-out of fossil fuels and rapid deployment of renewables compared to the NDC scenario before 2030, the majority of new low-carbon capacities is still expected to take up only after 2030. In addition, no region reaches net zero emissions by 2050 and neither does the MENA region as a whole. In the Climate Resilience scenario, energy-related CO2 emissions follow a similar path as in the Strong Industrial Policy scenario. The renewables uptake in this scenario is even stronger than in the Strong Industrial Policy scenario, particularly due to electricity demand for water desalination; there is also a role for gas with CCS in the long term to replace gas-based power generation in providing back-up generation for a predominantly renewables power mix. With additional negative emissions from reforestation announced as part of the Green Middle East initiative, in this scenario, the region reaches net zero emissions by 2050. In a few cases, the share of renewables in electricity supply is slightly lower in a more ambitious scenario than a less ambitious scenario. This reflects potential strains on the system to deliver higher demands for electricity. In particular, when the share of wind and solar is high, even though the levels of capacity and generation from renewables may increase in line with demand, more backup generation (based on other technologies) may also be needed due to the intermittency of such renewables. 18\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the emissions pathways simulated for each country or region that is modelled explicitly in E3ME, as well as an extrapolation of the MENA region’s CO2 emissions if the rest of the region (i.e. countries that are not explicitly represented in E3ME) follow the same trends. Figure 1: Total CO2 emissions by region and scenario in MtCO2\n\nNote: The results include emissions from land use and forestry. Solid lines are used for historical data and model results. Dashed lines are used for extrapolated values. MENA emissions are extrapolated based on trends of the sum of Algeria, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Egypt and UAE. 3.2 Macroeconomic impacts\n\nGDP and employment\n\nIn the Current Policies baseline, the MENA region is projected to grow at 3.4% per annum (pa) over 2023-50, mainly powered by consumption and investment. There is a substantial demand for oil and gas at the global level in this scenario, thus the level of investment and production of the oil and gas supply sectors in the MENA region are sustained and continue to grow over the forecast period. In the NDC scenario, GDP by 2050 is projected to be 2.2% lower for the MENA region as a whole, relative to the Current Policies baseline. 19\n\nInvestment is the main driver of GDP impacts. There are significant increases in investment in all regions, particularly in Saudi Arabia and strongest in the years to 2030, reducing thereafter as is frontloaded to deploy new technologies and build infrastructures in the medium term. Some of this positive impact, however, is offset by a worsening of the net trade balances relative to baseline, due to losses of oil & gas and manufactured fuels exports which has been a specialisation of the region. This significant reduction in fossil fuel exports is driven strongly by reduced demand for fossil fuels in the rest of the world. investment\n\nAmong countries modelled explicitly in E3ME, Egypt sees a positive impact on GDP in this Figure 2: GDP impact in the MENA region by scenario (relative to baseline)\n\nscenario due to large increases in investment in power generation to deliver ambitious renewable targets, driving demand for construction and manufacturing sectors as well. In contrast, UAE sees the highest negative impacts in relative terms due to substantial losses of employment in the oil & gas supply chain and increased government expenditure to compensate for stranded oil & gas assets (which are financed by the government and displace other final spending on public services). Total employment is marginally higher (0.03%) by 2050 compared to baseline for the MENA region (equivalent to 55,000 jobs). This is driven by a balancing between the more fossil-fuel dependent countries with ambitious NDC targets (concentrated in the Arab States region) in which there are substantial employment losses in the fossil-fuel supply chain, and the more diversified countries in the broader MENA region with less ambitious NDC targets and a slight increase in employment in this scenario (due to stronger presence of industries such as manufacturing and transport which are likely drawn on to support infrastructure building requirements across the whole region, therefore benefiting from decarbonization). This is also a reason why the GDP and employment results for the Arab States aggregate are generally less positive (or more negative) than results for the MENA aggregate. In the Strong Industrial Policy scenario, the MENA region’s GDP is 4.8% higher than baseline by 2050, albeit slightly below baseline in the years to 2030. The short-term negative impacts are due to higher prices, which result from increased costs of electricity (as carbon prices are introduced when there is still a noticeable share of fossil fuels in the power mix) and higher costs of production in sectors that are expected to make large investments to create new export industries (power supply, motor vehicles and transport). 20\n\nThe long-term positive impacts are driven by continued investment (27% above baseline by 2050) and prices coming back down over time, with positive effects for household consumption. The easing of price pressures over time is due to endogenous learning-by- doing effects which reduces costs of low-carbon energy and technologies as deployment scales up. After 2035, the model also projects significant gains in export revenues from green hydrogen (also EVs and solar to a lesser extent), which more than offset the loss in fossil fuel exports and contributes to positive GDP impacts. In this scenario, employment levels are 3.5% higher than baseline by 2050, and are higher than baseline in all MENA regions. In the Climate Resilience scenario, GDP and employment move in a similar direction with Figure 3: Employment impacts in the MENA region by scenario (relative to baseline)\n\neven higher differences to baseline than in Industrial Policy (7.2% and 5.3% higher than baseline by 2050, respectively). This is mainly due to increased investment in water desalination and reforestation (with relatively small changes to consumption and net trade). In parts of the region with high GDP per capita levels (including UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait), contributions to a regional fund for mitigation and adaptation means that tax increases are introduced in these countries, leading to a small negative impact on household consumption relative to the baseline (which however is offset by increases in nominal income due to increased investment). Figure 4 compares net employment impacts across the sub-regions and scenarios. 21\n\nInvestment financing needs\n\nFigure 4: Employment impacts by scenario and sub-region (relative to baseline)\n\nIt is estimated that net capital investment requirements relative to baseline2 for the MENA region, accumulated over the 2023-50 period, would be $1.3 trillion in the NDC scenario, $5 trillion in the Strong Industrial Policy scenario and $10 trillion in the Climate\n\nResilience scenario. Table 3 shows the contributions to financing needs by policy, for all additional investments and policy costs that are expected to occur in each scenario relative to the baseline. In the NDC scenario, the majority of financing needs is met by domestic private sources, in contrast with the net zero scenarios where the majority is assumed to originate from international sources (which are likely to be several times what has been put on offer so far by climate negotiations). 2 Additional investments minus investment reductions, both relative to baseline\n\n22\n\nThe reduction in demand for investment (and therefore financing) in fossil fuel supply industries implies that more funds are available domestically and can be redirected to support low-carbon investments. This can be seen from the negative contributions of fossil fuel supply investment which are offset by investment in low-carbon investments including renewable energy and hydrogen supply. However, the mitigation policies modelled in the net zero scenarios require higher levels of investment in low-carbon measures than the potential reduction in fossil fuel supply investment, in turn leading to strong indirect investment effects (captured in “Other industry investments”) as a result of increased demand for intermediate inputs such as machinery and equipment. This implies that the need for financing is higher in the policy scenarios, requiring mechanisms that do not already exist to leverage and channel funds towards the right investments. For example, revenues from carbon pricing can be an important source of domestic finances for green investments and other policy costs incurred by governments. On the other hand, lost oil royalties is the single largest driver affecting government revenues directly. For example, in the NDC scenario where this is borne by governments, there is a corresponding reduction in government expenditures. In the net zero scenarios, the loss of these oil royalty revenues relative to the baseline are assumed to be compensated by international financial support. This assumption emphasizes the need for the region to transition without harming social welfare, following from the narrative, and is a major contributor to strongly positive GDP results. Without this assumption, the region would see negative GDP and employment impacts similar to the NDC scenario. Cumulative lost oil royalties over 2023-50 are estimated to be equivalent to net investment requirements over the same period.

This is accompanied with lower demand for oil & gas, manufactured fuels (as a direct result of falling demand for fossil fuels, domestically as well as from the rest of the world also decarbonizing) and consumer goods and services sectors (due to loss income and consumption, partly linked to the negative impact on oil & gas and also driven by higher prices of energy in the medium term given the introduction of carbon pricing into an energy system still dominated by fossil fuels)."

        "This is similar in all MENA regions, but the magnitude of impact in different sectors varies. Employment trends closely follow output. However, job losses are more concentrated in public services sectors, because of reduced public spending in these activities as a result of governments bearing the burden of lost oil royalties (see Figure 5). In the Strong Industrial Policy scenario, sector employment results are similar to those in the NDC scenario, although one key difference is significant gains in demand and employment in hydrogen supply, power generation and construction as a result of new low- carbon industries being created (hydrogen, solar export, EV export). There are strong employment increases in electrical equipment and land transport which directly support the new industries (electrical equipment provides batteries for EVs, whereas land transport helps distribute the new industries’ products to other countries). Higher employment and output in hydrogen supply is particularly strong after 2030, driven by the region’s ambition to significantly scale up production from that point. As a result, higher activity in the electricity and hydrogen sectors offsets losses in oil & gas, manufactured fuels and gas supply. In the Climate Resilience scenario, sectoral impacts are similar to those of the Industrial Policy scenario, yet demand for ‘consumer goods and services’ is higher due to stronger economic growth. By design, there is also a noticeable shift of activity from rubber & plastics to water supply & waste (to reflect higher recycling rates), though this is small relative to the magnitude of other sectoral impacts. For each sector, the impact reflects all direct, indirect and induced effects captured by the model in response to the combined policy package. While it is not possible to decompose precisely the number of jobs that each policy is responsible for, based on the model logic and scenario design, it is possible to indicate where (in which sectors) direct impacts of policies (and in some cases also indirect impacts) are most likely to be observed. The results for individual sectors are described in more detail in the rest of this section. 24\n\nFigure 5: Employment impacts by sector in the MENA region in 2050 (relative to baseline)\n\n25\n\nNet winners\n\nElectricity supply\n\nHydrogen supply\n\nThe sectors with substantial net employment gains and transformational opportunities are electricity supply, hydrogen supply, vehicle and electrical engineering and construction. These sectors are critical to either providing low-carbon energy or supplying the infrastructure for its supply, particularly in the net zero scenarios. Figure 6: Employment impacts by sector in the Arab States in 2050 (relative to baseline)\n\nThe electricity sector is expected to gain considerably in the transition, with increasingly higher levels of employment in then sector across the MENA region as the scenarios become increasingly more ambitious (392,000, 462,000, and 780,000 workers by 2050 for each scenario respectively for the MENA aggregate relative to baseline values). Employment for the electricity sector is derived from the region’s power mix, taking into account different rates of employment intensities for different generation technologies. The employment increase is not only due to higher levels of electrification but also the progressively more present renewable-based power system in the more ambitious sectors (and renewables being more labour-intensive). The impacts of the region exporting solar- based electricity in the net zero scenarios are also observed in this sector. This is consistent across all MENA modelled countries. Employment in hydrogen supply is projected to be higher in both the Strong Industrial Policy and the Climate Resilience scenarios. The magnitude of the net effect is 2.9 million and 2.8 million workers added relative to the baseline by 2050 for each scenario respectively. This increase consists of the strongest increase in employment in both scenarios at the MENA regional aggregate level, more than outweighing the employment decrease in fossil-fuel related sectors. This is due to ambitious levels of investment in the\n\n26\n\nConstruction\n\nsector coupled with higher exports of hydrogen to foreign markets, allowing for strong growth of the sector and consequently creation of many new jobs across the region. Saudi Arabia and Egypt are expected to contribute the most hydrogen export revenues in absolute terms, reflecting the potential scale of existing pilot projects in these countries (such as NEOM and Suez Canal Economic Zone). However, the net zero scenarios illustrate other countries in the region (some of which are already developing green hydrogen strategies, while others have not) would also follow in a similar direction. The regional distribution of projected jobs impacts reflects this, as well as relative employment intensity differentials between countries. Figure 7: Employment impacts by sector in Saudi Arabia in 2050 (relative to baseline)\n\nThe construction sector is projected to see higher employment across all scenarios when compared to the baseline, with the positive effect being larger as the ambition of the scenario intensifies. Ordered by scenario ambition level, the net effect for the aggregate MENA region by 2050 is of 230,000, 1 million, and 1.9 million workers, respectively. The increase in employment is driven by the deployment of renewable and the ambition of the transition for the economy, which results in higher demand for construction of new and adaption/requalification of already existing infrastructure and buildings. After hydrogen supply, construction is the sector that sees the greatest increase in employment in both the Climate Resilience and the Strong Industrial Policy scenarios for the MENA regional aggregate. There is an exception, such as in Algeria & Libya in the NDC scenario, where the impact on construction jobs is negative. This is driven by the supply chain implications of reduced demand for oil and gas, which are not compensated by increased activities in green energy supply in this scenario. 27\n\nVehicle and electrical engineering sectors\n\nFor the MENA regional aggregate and across the two most ambitious scenarios (Strong Industrial Policy and Climate Resilience), the employment effect in the motor vehicles sector is projected to be between 366,000 and 1.5 million workers more by 2050 relative to the baseline. Similarly, the scenario results suggest between 805,000 and 814,000 more workers for the electrical engineering & instruments sector in the same year. The positive effects are strongly driven by the EV investment and export assumptions present in the Strong Industrial Policy and Climate Resilience scenarios (and applied to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE only to reflect these countries’ explicit EV production targets). Higher levels of investment in both sectors lead to increased production, which in turn causes greater demand for labour. Moreover, economic growth as seen in the Climate Resilience scenario induces additional Figure 8: Employment impacts by sector in Algeria & Libya in 2050 (relative to baseline)\n\nconsumer demand, positively impacting motor vehicles for example. This is the reason why the impact on the motor vehicles sector increases in the Climate Resilience scenario relative to the Strong Industrial Policy scenario while the impact on electrical engineering does not differ significantly between the two scenarios. Although the assumptions are designed to create domestic EV industries (largely represented by these two sectors), these two sectors also cover other activities not related to EVs, more generally non-transition-related equipment such as household electrical equipment. This means that a proportion of demand for these activities may still be met by imports when there is an increase in demand. This is dependent on the trade patterns that each country exhibits and implies that the positive impacts of domestic EV production may in some cases be counteracted by increased demand for imports of non-transition-related equipment (which reduces domestic employment). For example, Saudi Arabia is projected to see an increase in employment in motor vehicles but not in electrical engineering and equipment. In contrast, Egypt is project to see an increase of employment in both sectors. 28\n\nNet losers\n\nFossil-fuel sectors\n\nRubber & plastics\n\nThe sectors which will see major needs for restructuring and reskilling, due to negative impacts of the transition, are fossil fuel supply and rubber & plastics. The three fossil-fuel sectors (“oil & gas”, “manufactured fuels”, and “gas supply”) are projected to see a consistent decrease in employment across the MENA region throughout the modelling exercise’s scenarios. Across the scenarios, oil and gas employment decreases by between 129,000 and 163,000 workers, manufacturing fuels by 125,000 workers, and gas supply by between 309,000 and 405,000 workers, when comparing 2050 values to those of the baseline. This reduction in employment is mainly due to the effect of decarbonization policies in the region and the rest of the world. These policies indirectly reduce the output of these sectors by lowering the demand for fossil fuels. This translates in lower employment levels for the sectors. Though the lower employment levels are not dominated by a specific country, the potential employment loss (relative to the baseline) in the oil and gas and gas supply sectors occur mostly outside the Arab States region, whereas lower employment in the manufactured fuels sector is more strongly felt in the Arab States region. This is linked to different specializations within the region as well as differences in labour productivity. For example, given declining oil and gas demand globally, it may still be profitable for the Arab States (which have access to large reserves and can therefore extract oil and gas at low costs) to continue extraction activities for domestic consumption. This is less likely the case for non- Arab States with higher costs, and therefore consumers in these regions are more likely incentivized to switch to imported fuels or non-fossil sources. The recycling and the waste management policies which enter into effect in the Climate Resilience scenario lead to lower employment in the rubber & plastics sector, reducing it by around 462,000 workers across the whole MENA region in the Climate Resilience scenario relative to the baseline by 2050. The policies are responsible for an economy- wide decrease in demand for rubber and plastics (accompanied by an increase in water supply & waste demand), reducing the sector’s output and consequently demand for labour and sectoral employment. The accelerated recycling rate policy is only included in the Climate Resilience scenario, whereas the sector is affected by second order effects transmitted through supply chains in all scenarios. The minor increase in employment in the NDC and Strong Industrial Policy (in contrast with the noticeably negative effects in the Climate Resilience scenario) is therefore due to this difference in assumptions. Looking at regional level, the MENA region result is dominated by what happens in Saudi Arabia, where it is felt strongest given that, based on historical data, the country has a higher reliance on domestic production to meet its demand, while the other regions present a greater relative weight on imports to meet demand. For this reason, the county’s domestic production, and consequently, employment is impacted more strongly in relative terms. 29\n\nFollowers and adapters\n\nWater supply & waste\n\nForestry\n\nFigure 9: Employment impacts by sector in Egypt in 2050 (relative to baseline)\n\nSectors which are expected to see moderate employment gains from the transition are water supply & waste, forestry, chemicals and land transport. In addition, public services, advanced manufacturing and other sectors are likely to experience supply chain impacts of varying degrees, positive or negative. One thing these sectors have in common is that they are dependent on (thus follow or adapt to the needs of) the sectors mentioned above, as well as the policy environment. Water supply & waste is expected to experience a large positive (78,000 workers) employment effect for the aggregate MENA region by 2050 in the Climate Resilience scenario relative to the baseline. This is due to the effect of increased recycling, investment in waste management and water desalination, which is only simulated in this scenario. The waste management and water desalination policies assume an increase in investment in the water supply & waste sector, resulting in larger output and consequently a higher level of employment in the sector. Moreover, the previously mentioned recycling assumptions are associated with an increase of demand for the water management sector (at the expense of the rubber and plastic sector) also leading to higher sector output and consequently employment. Saudi Arabia’s employment is expected to have the largest relative impact in the sector with a 32% increase by 2050 compared to the baseline. However, the impact in absolute terms (18,000 workers) is not dominant at the MENA level. The forestry sector is projected to see higher employment levels in the Climate Resilience scenario thanks to increased investment in reforestation to reflect policies such as the Middle East Green Initiative. At the MENA aggregate level, additional employment equates\n\n30\n\nto 406,000 workers by 2050 and relative to baseline values. The increased investment pushes up the demand for labour in the sector. Chemicals\n\nA net positive employment effect is projected for the chemical sector, in both the Strong Industrial Policy and Climate Resilience scenarios relative to baseline values. This decline, dominated by Egypt, is equivalent to 15,000 and 69,000 jobs in each scenario, by 2050. Two opposite indirect effects are at play. One the one hand, the expansion of hydrogen production (present in both scenarios) creates a larger demand for chemical inputs and consequently increases both the output and employment for the chemical sector. On the other hand, the reduction in demand for rubber and plastics (assumed in the Climate Resilience) results in lower demand for chemical inputs and consequently lower employment in the sector. Land transport Figure 10: Employment impacts by sector in UAE in 2050 (relative to baseline)\n\nLand transport is projected to see, by 2050, higher employment relative to the baseline by 240,000 in the Climate Resilience and by 151,000 for the Strong Industrial Policy scenario for the aggregate MENA region. In the NDC scenario, the equivalent increase is by 22,000 only. The main driver behind these employment gains in the two more ambitious scenarios are land transport infrastructure investments to construct export channels for green hydrogen and solar electricity. On the other hand, as demand for transport of fossil fuels decrease, this sector is likely impacted negatively as a result. The scenario results suggest that employment gains are concentrated outside the Arab States region whereas the Arab States region sees employment losses in land transport throughout the three scenarios. This suggests that the supply chain of transport activities spans across the MENA region and cross-country coordination is key to developing new export infrastructures benefitting the whole region. 31\n\nPublic sectors\n\nNon-consumer- oriented manufacturing sectors\n\nAgriculture and consumer and business goods and services\n\nPublic services sectors are among the largest employers (by the number of workers employed) in the MENA region, although their shares in employment have been declining. The scenario results suggest that the three public sector sectors (“Public Administration & Defence”, “Education”, and “Health & Social Work”), at the MENA regional level, would see higher levels of employment by 2050 in the two more ambitious scenarios. Public administration and defence employment is 45,000 to 43,000 workers above the baseline, education has 19,000 to 18,000 additional jobs relative to the baseline, while health & social work accounts for 245,000 to 266,000 additional workers. In contrast to the ambitious scenarios, the NDC scenario presents, by the same year and relative to the baseline, 290,000 fewer workers in public administration and defence, 299,000 fewer workers in education, and 79,000 additional workers in health & social work. In the Strong Industrial Policy and Climate Resilience scenarios, MENA countries are assumed to receive international support in the form of compensation for stranded assets, oil royalty losses and training costs. This results in a lower strain on government finances, allowing governments to maintain funding for these sectors and safeguard jobs. In the NDC scenario, a lower level of employment is due to governments bearing the loss of oil royalties, with reduced spending on other services as a result. The non-consumer-oriented manufacturing sectors consist of “non-metallic mineral products”, “basic metals”, “metal goods”, “mechanical engineering”, and “electronics”. For this group of sectors, there are higher employment levels as the scenarios become more ambitious. For these sectors combined, at the MENA regional level, employment increases by 897,000, 582,000, and 1.4 million for each of the scenarios, relative to the baseline by 2050. Given that these sectors provide materials, components and equipment used in the construction, adaption / requalification, and maintenance of infrastructure and buildings, this increase in employment is linked to the ambition of the transition and the deployment of new renewable energy capacity. For example, a wind-power mill will require metal, electronics, engineering components, and equipment to be built (both for the structure itself and for the construction process) as well as for its continued maintenance. The remaining sectors (“agriculture”, “other mining”, “food, drink & tobacco”, “textiles, clothing & leather”, “wood & paper”, “printing & publishing”, “pharmaceuticals”, “other transport equipment”, “other manufacturing”, “distribution”, “retailing”, “hotels & catering”, “water transport”, “air transport”, “communications”, “banking & finance”, “insurance”, “computing services”, “professional services”, “other business services”, “miscellaneous services”) are not subject to any direct impact of the policies. They could nonetheless see more moderate indirect effects from other sectors through supply chains. The results for the retail sectors are particularly noteworthy here, given its relative size in the overall economy. As a sector predominantly serving consumers, the employment impact in retailing is strongly driven by impacts on overall household consumption. Despite the creation of new employment which increases nominal income, increasing price levels reduce real incomes and consequently consumption levels. This is reflected in the reduction in retail employment, which is the largest for the Climate Resilience scenario, the scenario with highest projected inflation. Not all sectors that are usually considered consumers-serving, however, see similarly large negative employment impacts as retailing. There are two possible reasons for this. On the one hand, some sectors are likely less sensitive to local price pressures. For example, food and clothing are basic necessities which are demanded regardless of prices, whereas hotels & catering serve high numbers of overseas visitors who are less responsive to local prices than local residents. On the other hand, some sectors which serve households as well as industries are likely to see transition-related activities gaining shares over traditional\n\n32\n\ngoods demands in the net zero scenarios. As such, they are expected to see more benefits from low-carbon activities than potential losses in consumer spending. 3.4 Labour market implications\n\nLabour groups\n\nWhile the analysis is focused on implications for employment for different economic sectors, there are insights for labour groups from these sectoral results which have\n\nimportant policy implications. First of all, the World Economic Forum (2017) illustrates that the MENA region’s employment consists of predominantly medium-skilled workers, with smaller shares of similar magnitudes being attributed to high- and low-skilled workers. In a low-carbon transition, as technologies continue to evolve and new industries which did not exist before emerge in the region, there are likely growing demands for highly skilled workers. For example, International Renewable Energy Agency (2012) argues that jobs in renewable energy are on average highly skilled and require graduates from higher education and vocational degrees to fill positions in engineering, research and development, system design and installation (which correspond to sectors with the highest levels of net job creation as demonstrated by the scenario results). In addition, the region faces high levels of youth and women unemployment, as well as low levels of economic participation among women (International Labour Organization, 2015b). As shown in Figure 11, female participation rates average around 15% of the female working\n\nFigure 11: Female participation and youth unemployment rates in MENA countries in 2021\n\nSource: Note:\n\nILO modelled estimates. The MENA average is an arithmetic average of the country-specific rates. age population and are significantly lower (by at least half) than male participation rates in almost all MENA countries. Youth unemployment rates are also higher for females, on average at 40% compared to around 25% for males. In the modelled scenarios, significantly higher demands for labour mean increased opportunities for all, including these marginalized groups. The results capture potential wage increases (as a result of increased demand for workers) which not only improve pay for existing workers but also create additional incentives for inactive working-age members of the population to join the workforce. This will need to be supported by investment in training in the ambitious net zero scenarios, as well as additional social protection and active labour market policies not explicitly modelled for this analysis. This is consistent with other research which attributes high rates of youth unemployment in the MENA region to demographic changes in the 1990s and 2000s creating excess labour supply, gaps in education systems and misaligned expectations between workers and available positions (Kabbani, 2019). 33\n\nFinally, the distribution of jobs across sectors implies that demand for jobs by age, gender and citizenship would shift over the projection period. For example, sectors which are on a growing trajectory due to decarbonization (notably low-carbon industries) will likely be attracting youth more than declining fossil fuel supply industries. Among sectors expected to see strong positive impacts, energy and manufacturing sectors tend to have relatively low shares of female workers compared to males, whereas consumer and business services and public sectors in particular tend to have a more balanced gender split (according to ILO statistics on employment by sex and economic activity). Similarly, historically the region (particularly the Arabs States) has had high shares of migrant workers in low-skilled and low-paid jobs in construction and hospitality, which are expected to see different directions and magnitudes of impacts across scenarios depending on the policies being introduced. It is also likely that increased demand for higher-skilled labour in a low-carbon economy will create growing flows of high-skilled labour migration from other parts of the world into MENA. 34\n\nTable 4: Female and migrant shares of sectoral employment in selected MENA countries\n\nISIC Rev.4 sector\n\nShare of female workers in 2021 (%\n\nShare of migrant workers (%\n\nof sectoral employment)\n\nof sectoral employment)\n\nIraq\n\nEgypt\n\nJordan\n\nUAE\n\nLebanon\n\nJordan\n\nSaudi\n\n(2019)\n\n(2021)\n\nArabia\n\n(2017)\n\nA.

This is because they currently work in sectors that are only seeing impacts through indirect channels which are strongly linked to underlying economic structures and influenced by the availability and mechanisms of financing for investments. Therefore, there is a need to direct training and support to these groups to create a level-playing field for them to take advantage of emerging low-carbon job\n\nopportunities. The employment impacts discussed in section Error! Reference source not found. are assumed to materialize from direct policy interventions as well as indirect economic feedbacks, conditional on training and reskilling being provided across the economy to allow workers to take up relevant job opportunities. Training and reskilling needs account for 2-4% of total financing needs (see Table 3) and are calculated based on the assumptions for numbers of people receiving training and average cost of training per person. Training requirements would differ for different groups of workers, for example:\n\nWorkers in the fossil fuel supply industries who may be displaced by the energy transition would require reskilling to relocate to a different sector or occupation. Existing workers in sectors that are expected to remain unaffected or expand as a result of the transition would require training to adapt to the evolving low-carbon working environment and continued technological progress. The youth would require different types of training to prepare them for joining the labour market, including secondary education and vocational training. All displaced workers in fossil fuel extraction industries, 10% of the remaining workforce in other sectors and 20% of youth are assumed to receive training. This is equivalent to a minimum3 of 16 million trainees in the ambitious net zero scenarios by 2050 (including 300,000 fossil fuel workers4, 7.9 million workers in other sectors and 8 million young people). This is equivalent to around 8-10% of the projected workforce in 2050, across the scenarios. In the modelled scenarios, training is implicitly assumed to be administered by governments. However, in practice, training activities are likely to be delivered by a combination of private and public entities. The collaboration between private and public sectors helps ensure inclusion and equity are taken into account in policy and investment decisions. For example, although training was not differentiated across labour groups in the modelling, historical data indicate that there is an existing gap in educational attainment between genders in many MENA countries, at all levels of education (see\n\nTable 5). Policies should therefore consider improved access and provision for female workers as a key priority, alongside upskilling the youth. This is echoed by survey results compiled by PwC (2022) which show that tailored training and development opportunities are one of the top characteristics that attract women (particularly young women) in the workplace. 3 This is a minimum estimate, as it only covers workers in Algeria, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Egypt and UAE. 4 Only jobs that are displaced directly by the transition are considered. In reality, there are likely existing jobs that would\n\nnaturally exit the labour market due to automation and retirements, as well as jobs that will remain to serve a small number\n\nof sectors and activities where fossil fuels cannot be replaced completely even in the net zero scenarios. 36\n\nTable 5: Attainment of advanced education in selected MENA countries in 2021\n\n% of\n\n% of male\n\n% of female\n\n% of male\n\n% of\n\n% of male\n\nfemale\n\nworking-\n\nworking-age\n\nworking-age\n\nfemale\n\nworking-\n\nworking-\n\nage\n\npopulation\n\npopulation\n\nworking-\n\nage\n\nage\n\npopulation\n\nwith\n\nwith\n\nage\n\npopulation\n\npopulation\n\nwith basic\n\nintermediate\n\nintermediate\n\npopulation\n\nwith\n\nwith basic\n\neducation\n\neducation\n\neducation\n\nwith\n\nadvanced\n\neducation\n\nadvanced\n\neducation\n\neducation\n\nComoros\n\n28\n\n45\n\n43\n\n50\n\n70\n\n84\n\nEgypt\n\n5\n\n51\n\n16\n\n74\n\n44\n\n81\n\nIraq\n\n4\n\n52\n\n11\n\n53\n\n63\n\n83\n\nJordan\n\n5\n\n64\n\n9\n\n60\n\n50\n\n73\n\nQatar\n\n54\n\n96\n\n53\n\n91\n\n69\n\n98\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\n24\n\n65\n\n31\n\n79\n\n54\n\n93\n\nOman\n\n27\n\n83\n\n24\n\n78\n\n61\n\n92\n\nUAE\n\n53\n\n86\n\n41\n\n88\n\n56\n\n96\n\nOccupied\n\n4\n\n68\n\n11\n\n65\n\n61\n\n85\n\nPalestian\n\nTerritory\n\nSource: Note:\n\nWorld Bank – World Development Indicators. “Basic education” includes primary education or lower secondary education. “Intermediate education” includes upper secondary or post-secondary non tertiary education. “Advanced education” includes short-cycle tertiary education, a bachelor’s degree or equivalent education level, a master’s degree or equivalent education level, or doctoral degree or equivalent education level. It is also noteworthy that there must be an inter-industry coordination effort to mobilize and redistribute local human capital through systematic linking of existing and new green initiatives (which so far have been undertaken by isolated industries). Failing to implement this effectively may result in skills mismatches and other labour market frictions such as inability to fill vacancies (for firms), underemployment and low productivity (for workers). If training was not available, the net employment gains discussed in previous sections, particularly in new industries, are likely to be constrained. This impacts the scale of the overall positive macroeconomic results. In addition, the modelling also assumes all training is effective. If this is not the case, the cost of training may be higher than assumed or the productivity of trained workers may be reduced, both of which will also reduce the magnitude of overall impacts. Detailed assumptions and calculations of training costs are as set out in detail in 1.11.1.1.1.Appendix B. 37\n\n4 Conclusions\n\n4.1\n\nSummary of results\n\nThe global energy transition poses potential opportunities and risks to economic welfare of the MENA region, depending on today’s policy choices. Due to high dependency on fossil fuel use and exports, and the potential negative effects of climate policies enacted outside the MENA region, there is a need for the region to adapt and invest in its own low-carbon economy in order to take advantage of the transition. The analysis demonstrates that:\n\nAs a passive by-stander to the global energy transition, MENA faces potential losses in jobs and welfare. This is shown in the NDC scenario which features only modest emission reduction ambitions and is not accompanied by any employment and industrial policies. Higher decarbonisation ambition and corresponding investments would lead to positive economic benefits for the MENA region in the medium and long term, creating low- carbon industries to diversify and eventually replace the oil and gas industry at a higher level of economic and social development. In all scenarios, each country and sector are impacted differently with winners and losers from the transition. Notably, the fossil fuel value chain would be restructured towards growth opportunities in clean electricity and hydrogen supply and export, electric vehicle manufacturing and construction, to name but a few. In the net zero scenarios, potential gains in opportunities in new low-carbon industries and their supply chains can outweigh potential losses in fossil fuel related sectors. The cost of investment and the cost of stranded assets are high (in the region of $10 trillion in cumulative terms over 2023-50) but are paying off and yield higher productivity and employment levels in 2030 and 2050. This implies that outcomes are sensitive to the financing assumptions made. In a scenario with substantial international financing the benefits are high while the costs for the local population low. Without such funding the transition would put higher strain on governments’ financial balances, and outcomes are most likely less positive. 4.2 Policy implications\n\nThe economic and employment outlook for MENA countries will be determined by the following overarching trends of the global energy transition. Geopolitical, energy security and climate concerns are fast tracking the global energy transition. With more than 100 countries having pledged to net zero, investments in low carbon technology outpaced investments into fossil fuels for the first time 2023. Driven by strong industrial policies around the world renewable energy investments are set to reach $1.7 trillion overtaking the $1 trillion in unabated fossil fuels (IEA 2023). Leading countries in the energy transition are harnessing first mover advantages, clean-tech monopolies, export markets and some 13.7 million renewable energy jobs created globally. Countries in the MENA region – with their comparative advantage and expertise in energy technology, abundant renewable resources and youthful labour market – have the potential to catch up and enact best practice green industrial and just transition policies. MENA could become a new leader in the energy transition. Significant welfare gains could be achieved as compared to a business-as-usual scenario. This would require a shift in gear. 38\n\nThe main policy implications for MENA countries to catch up and become active drivers in the accelerating global energy transition are following:\n\nIntegrated climate, industrial and just transition policies. Strong industrial and climate resilient policies, matched with just transition policies, will yield significant positive results in terms of social, employment and welfare. Thus, integrated climate, industrial and social policies which are bold enough to fast track and leapfrog the energy transition in MENA would make it a winner in the energy transition to net zero 2050. This reflects export potentials and new job opportunities for the local population and the private sector, who will require training to address ongoing labour market challenges as well as upskilling to adapt to an evolving low-carbon environment. In MENA countries where the labour demand cannot be met nationally due to population constraints, labour mobility may be a complement. Skills needs assessment system are required to target green sectors, provide career guidance and employment services and upgrade market relevant skills delivery for green sector occupations with flexible skills training and certification systems. Just transition policies\n\nTo ensure a just transition that brings about the most employment and economic benefits, policies should include a combination of climate, energy, industrial, economic and social elements. A mixed industrial and economic policy basket that includes incentives for low-carbon technologies and industries, disincentives for fossil fuels, public investments, redirection of investments from oil and gas into clean-tech and regulatory measures are recommended. To achieve social and employment gains, the economic and industrial policies need to be matched with strong just transition policies. Key to enable positive labour market outcomes are the reskilling of fossil fuel workers and their social protection to ensure frictionless industrial restructuring. Technical and vocational education and skills training for the young matched with investments into eco-innovation, incubation and green entrepreneurship would create a vibrant private sector. Skills gaps may emerge and need to be addressed with technical and vocational training and reskilling to match the likely growing demands for highly skilled workers. Importantly, significantly higher demands for labour mean increased opportunities for all, including marginalized groups with impacts on the distribution of jobs across sectors, age, gender and citizenship. To address potential mismatches and ensure a frictionless restructuring, targeted active labour market policies are required. They could address the region’s high levels of youth unemployment, and low levels of economic participation among women. To address existing structural inequalities in the labour market, inclusion, and equity with a particular focus on gender, migrant workers and most vulnerable groups may be required. Dedicated programs may link disadvantaged workers to big green initiatives. Financing and Just Transition Fund\n\nA key question exists around the financing of new clean tech investments, and offsetting of losses in oil & gas revenues and asset values. Alternative options to reduce reliance on international sources of funding may include royalties from green hydrogen and solar exports, progressive environmental taxes (in addition to progressive carbon prices), energy subsidy reforms matched with social transfers to those most impacted, IMF special drawing rights, Central Bank Green Bonds at reduced or no interest rates and sovereign wealth funds investments into green and climate funds. Each option would impact the results in different directions which need to be assessed. 39\n\n A Just Transition Fund could be set to up channel national and international revenues into specific just transition programs, notably low-carbon investments, skills, social protection and economic diversification and enterprise development. Regional integration\n\nThere are noticeable benefits from regional collaboration, as increased decarbonization in one part of the region will support cost reductions in others. The establishment of a regional investment and just transition fund for financing skills training and entrepreneurship, reskilling and social protection, mitigation and adaptation measures would facilitate this process. A just transition emphasizes a participatory approach to environmental and social sustainability through social dialogue. Social dialogue gives voice to the concerns and needs of workers, employers, and communities affected by the transition towards net zero emissions, helps build trust, and form consensus. Social dialogue among ministries and organizations representing both workers and employers is crucial in drafting decarbonization strategies and plans to address the labour issues inherent in decarbonization. 40\n\nAppendices\n\n41\n\nAppendix A E3ME description\n\nAs a global E3 model, E3ME can provide comprehensive analysis of policies:\n\ndirect impacts, for example reduction in energy demand and emissions, fuel switching and renewable energy;\n\nsecondary effects, for example on fuel suppliers, energy price and competitiveness impacts;\n\n\n\nrebound effects of energy and materials consumption from lower price, spending on energy or higher economic activities;\n\noverall macroeconomic impacts; on jobs and economy including income distribution at macro and sectoral level. The basic structure of the model shows the linkages and feedbacks between the economy, the energy system and the environment, underpinned by technological progress. Figure 0.1: Schematic of the E3ME model\n\nSource(s): Cambridge Econometrics. Theoretical underpinnings\n\nEconomic activity undertaken by persons, households, firms and other groups in society has effects on other groups (possibly after a time lag), and the effects may persist into future generations. But there are many actors and the effects, both beneficial and damaging, accumulate in economic and physical stocks. The effects are transmitted through the environment, through the economy and the price and money system (via the markets for labour and commodities), and through global transport and information networks. The markets transmit effects in three main ways: through the level of activity creating demand for inputs of materials, fuels and labour; through wages and prices affecting incomes; and through incomes leading in turn to further demands for goods and services. These interdependencies suggest that an E3 model should be comprehensive and include many linkages between different parts of the economic and energy systems. Basic structure and data\n\nThe structure of E3ME is based on the system of national accounts, with further linkages to energy demand and environmental emissions. The labour market is also covered in detail, including both voluntary and involuntary unemployment. In total there are 33 sets of econometrically estimated equations, also including the components of GDP (consumption, investment, international trade), prices, energy demand and materials demand. Each equation set is disaggregated by country and by sector. E3ME’s historical database covers the period 1970-2018 and the model projects forward annually to 2050. The main data sources for European countries are Eurostat and the IEA, supplemented by the OECD’s STAN database and other sources where appropriate. For regions outside Europe, additional sources for data include the UN, OECD, World Bank, IMF, ILO and national statistical agencies. Gaps in the data are estimated using customised software algorithms. The main dimensions of E3ME are:\n\n71 countries – all G20 and major world economies, the EU28 and candidate countries plus other countries’ economies grouped. 44 (or 70 in Europe) industry sectors, based on standard international classifications\n\n28 (or 43 in Europe) categories of household expenditure. 25 different users of 12 different fuel types. 14 types of air-borne emission (where data are available) including the 6 GHG’s monitored under the Kyoto Protocol. Linking E3ME to bottom-up technologies submodules (FTTs)\n\nSince 2012, the power sector in E3ME has been represented using a novel framework for the dynamic selection and diffusion of innovations, initially developed by J.-F. Mercure (Mercure, 2012), called FTT:Power (Future Technology Transformations for the Power sector). This is the first member of the FTT family of technology diffusion models. The current E3ME model version is also linked up to FTT:Transport, FTT: Steel and FTT:Heat. Drawing on an evolutionary approach, the FTT models use a decision- making core for investors or households facing several options in their purchasing decisions. The model is based on theories of technology diffusion, with rates of diffusion affected by relative market shares and\n\n43\n\ntechnology prices. The detailed technology representation allows for a range of policy options. Many of the policies are characterised by long lag times due to the lifetimes of the technologies that are built. However, the model can show rapid transitions as technologies gain market penetration, reinforced by cost reductions that result from learning rates. The resulting diffusion of competing technologies is constrained by a global database of renewable and non-renewable resources (Mercure & Salas, 2012, 2013). 44\n\nAppendix B Detailed assumptions\n\nThe region’s combined GDP is projected to be 4% above the baseline scenario by 2030, according to a study done by IMF (Anderson et. al., 2022). It is estimated that the region will witness around $700 billion investment in renewable energy transition between 2020 and 2050 (Zawya, 2022). They expect to reach 300 million electric vehicles by 2040, and more the 60% of the total active vehicles by 2050. In the region’s power sector, total investment shall be more than $250 billion (including $60 billion in Saudi Arabia and $37 billion in Egypt). Besides meeting energy demand through affordable and sustainable solutions, the MENA countries need to pay attention to the wider socio- economic effects of the transition. Policy making must keep in mind the perspective and incentives of smaller minorities and special groups of the labour force. It is crucial for both enabling the policies to reach their full potential and the set targets while also relevant for the safety of these social groups. Grid infrastructure\n\nElectricity grids are the backbone of the energy transition; however, the current infrastructure is not yet ready to facilitate electricity flow required to reach net-zero scenarios by 2050. It is estimated that at least $21.4 trillion needs to be invested by 2050 globally according to BloombergNEF (2023). The Middle East is also expected to speed up and spend heavily on smart electricity grids. Total investment is on track to reach $17.6 billion by 2027 (Malek, 2021). The unit rate for solar energy investment is reducing year- on-year. This doesn’t mean that a capital decline suggests a slowdown of the industry, on the contrary it indicates that the number of gigawatts installed remain high. It is expected that stationary battery storage market size will surpass $170 billion by 2030, according to Global Market Insights (REGlobal, 2020). Furthermore, the GCC countries’ grid interconnectivity is expected to generate US$ 33 billion in investments, economic and energy savings over the next 25 years. Energy export\n\nMany of the regional countries rely heavily on oil production and export as a major part of their GDP. This poses a huge economic threat to them in the future. Most governments have already recognized this and are aiming to prepare for it by building alternative solutions. One potential option is to build renewable energy capacities, which can replace oil export in the future. Solar energy is one of the most promising and abundant types of renewables globally, and it is especially relevant in the MENA region as well. There are several papers which examine the potential of solar energy export from the region (Zubair, 2019, 2021). There are three major factors\n\n45\n\nthat determine the economic viability of it: energy production capabilities, transmission channel, energy demand of potential buyers. Firstly, the production capabilities of the region are ideal for solar energy generation because of the relatively high number of sunny hours in a day. The second issue is to find whether exporting is still economically feasible, even after accounting for the energy loss during transmission and calculating with the demand and energy prices of the buyer country. Studies have empirically shown that exports to Europe, North-Africa and Asia have a positive NPV (net present value) from even the furthest parts of the MENA region. The highest potential countries are Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. The Institute of Engineering Thermodynamics at the German Aerospace Center (Müller-Steinhagen et. al., 2008) estimates that, based on solar potential in the region and the potential shortfall in capacity to meet demand in Europe, by 2050 interconnection between the EU and the MENA region could reach a maximum capacity of 100GW, transferring 700TWh per year, with investment of around $450bn over 2020-50. Researchers in the region foresee economically-viable solar energy export using a multi- terminal transmission from Saudi Arabia to Greece via Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, and Turkey with the net present value of $2.5bn for a power purchase agreement of $0.11/kWh (Zubair, 2019, 2021). Furthermore, the TuNur project in Tunisia is expected to generate 9.4MWh per year with the first phase involving 85 million euros of investment for 250MW of capacity and a further 1.6 billion euros for the cable between the Saraha Desert and Europe. Hydrogen production\n\nGreen hydrogen is considered a crucial solution to decarbonize “hard-to- abate” sectors and therefore forecasting its future price is crucial and is of big interest to many. Some say it will be available for ~$0.5/kg, while others estimate it to be available for ~$3/kg, in 2022 real terms. The $3 price would be equivalent to ~$80/MWh, higher than natural gas prices today. (Wan, L., Butterworth, P., 2023)\n\nThe region hopes to build its own infrastructure in hydrogen production which could serve both the purpose of becoming independent of foreign markets (Europe) and as an investment opportunity for further future exports, mostly to Asia. It is estimated that all announced hydrogen plants in the region is worth over $70bn (MEED, 2022). Altogether nine projects were announced at the COP27 conference in 2022, with Egypt, the conference’s host country presenting most of the plans. If all these projects are turned into final investment and are fully implemented, they’re supposed to be worth $83 billion and to produce collectively 7.6 million tons of green ammonia and 2.7 million tons of green hydrogen per year (Wan & Butterworth, 2023). Egypt’s green hydrogen plan aims to achieve 1.4GW of production capacity by 2030 and requires $40bn of investment (Energy & Utilities, 2022). Egypt has potential to reduce the cost of hydrogen from under $3/kg to $1.7/kg (Ivanova, 2022), comparable to estimates by the IEA (IEA, 2019b) for green hydrogen production costs in resource-rich countries. 46\n\nSaudi Arabia launched a “Saudi Green Initiative” in 2021 and is planning the development of green hydrogen and green ammonia production around “NEOM” (a new city area currently being built by the country), together with thirteen renewable energy projects with a combined capacity of 11.3 GW that could reduce 20 million tons of carbon emission per year (Saudi & Middle East Green Initiatives, 2021). Oman has also launched a strategic plan on green hydrogen, estimated around $140 billion in investment by 2050, targeting an annual production of 1-1.25 MT of green hydrogen by 2030, rising to 3.25-3.75 MT by 2040 and 7.5-8.5 MT by 2050. Furthermore, Oman is working on building a green steel plant fed by hydrogen, with an annual production of 5 million tons and to be exported to other MENA countries (International Energy Agency, 2023c). Electric vehicle production\n\nThe region has been pushing domestic production electric vehicles, with facilities opened in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE recently aiming to produce 420,000, 20,000 and 55,000 units per year by 2025, respectively (Arabian Business, 2023; Arab News, 2022). Saudi Arabia in particular is expected to drive the regional EV market, having bought a majority stake in the US-based EV manufacturer Lucid Group secured through the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund (Economist Intelligence Unit, 2023). It also targets to produce 500,000 EVs by 2030, export 150,000 units by 2026 and is expected to invest $50bn in production facilities over the next decade. Just transition\n\nJust transition is an element that has been increasingly recognized in importance across the region. However, out of all countries in the region, few mention just transition in existing NDC plans and none includes detailed targets or implementation policies. The impact of changes in climate indicators on labour supply in the region poses a great threat to every aspect of societies including labour market and general living conditions. The most important are changes in temperature and humidity which can significantly reduce safe and healthy working hours of the region, and in effect it has a negative effect on day-to- day business operations by altering the labour supply. The ILO is leading the region’s programme in transitioning to a green future of work, and submitted a document that globally outlines the principles of a just transition to environmentally sustainable economies and societies. The low- and middle-income countries such as Algeria, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan. Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen are particularly vulnerable to the direct and indirect effects of global warming. On the other hand, countries such as Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia pose lower limits to adaptive capacity building. Training and reskilling\n\n47\n\nA problem of the region is its high dependence on fossil fuel jobs. In most places of the world, the ratio of fossil-fuel works among all energy related jobs compared to the ratio of renewable energy works is relatively low. However, in the MENA region the fossil fuel jobs take up a much higher proportion of all energy jobs which creates additional vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the skill needs of the energy sector is relatively high compared to other sectors which creates a sectoral employment issue. An important economic question is how much it will cost to reskill fossil fuel workers and prepare them for working in the renewable energy or in other sectors. A study by the European Commission (Vandeplas et. al., 2022) suggests that the skills gaps that require relocation training are overall small and mainly concentrated in extraction workers whose skills profiles are highly unique and significantly different from other occupations. The cost of retraining mining workers is estimated to be 10,000 euros. The study also assumes smaller training costs for workers in non-mining sectors to adapt to a low-carbon work environment, roughly 1500 euros for jobs in manufacturing and agriculture sectors and 500 euros for all other jobs. Furthermore, a study by Greenpeace (2021) shows that there’s a high level of support among oil industry workers to alter their careers to green sectors. However, their reskilling is too costly for them, reportedly having to spend around 2100 euros yearly on average. They support the idea of an “offshore passport” that allows them to work across sectors if they hold a certificate of minimum requirements. Youth unemployment\n\nThe MENA has the highest total and youth unemployment rates worldwide. The youth is especially vulnerable compared to other regions which creates social conflict and also a great underutilization of the workforce’s potential in the national economy. The ILO (2022) modelled a scenario of green policy measures and found that by 2030, an additional 8.4 million jobs worldwide could be added for young people aged 15-29. Out of those jobs, the Arab States could account for 437,000 jobs. This is substantial to the youth population of the region compared to the rest of the world and can be explained by the region’s high dependency on fossil fuels and higher costs of investments required for green adaptation. The United Nations (2020) reported that 20% of the youth population in the Arab region (which makes up the majority of the MENA region) is not in employment, education or training. Among member countries, Egypt has been running a Technical and Vocational Education and Training Reform Programme (TVET) funded by the government and the European Union to address issues such as youth unemployment, which is reported to cost 50,000 Egyptian pounds (equivalent to around $1600) per person (Dailynews Egypt, 2019). Climate adaptation\n\nThe MENA region is highly vulnerable to physical change impacts, putting human activities and natural systems at high risk. There are specific sectors which are especially relevant within the region and at the same time highly sensitive to climate changes, such as agriculture and coastal areas. The\n\n48\n\nregion has managed to set up both mitigation and adaptation strategies, however most of them are highly dependent on international support in financing. Due to rapid population growth, urbanization and industrialization, the MENA is at risk of water scarcity. However, with an abundance of solar, the potential for desalination is vast. Initiatives such as the MENA Desalination Projects Forum have been established to address water risks and invest in desalination facilities particularly in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE (TradeArabia, 2022). In addition, the Middle East Green Initiative aims to plant 50 billion trees (including 10 billion in Saudi Arabia) in the coming decades across the region (Saudi & Middle East Green Initiatives, 2021).

A target of 20% was assumed for the share of electricity generation from renewable sources by 2030, an average of Algeria and Libya’s targets. Renewable sources include nuclear, biomass, hydro, wind and solar. The sector-level targets were assumed as indicated for transport and electricity sectors, for 2030 relative to the level of CO2 emissions in the Current Policies baseline (Oil & gas emissions is not explicitly tracked in E3ME).

A target of 5% reduction in CO2 emissions was assumed for the Rest of OPEC aggregate, by 2030, relative to the Current Policies baseline. By 2050, CO2 emissions reduce significantly by at least 25% relative to the Current Policies baseline, due to net zero being achieved in Kuwait by 2060 but no target in Iraq and Kuwait accounts for one- third of their combined emissions currently. This is an average of Iraq and Kuwait’s targets and assumes that non-CO2 emissions reduce in line with CO2 emissions.

Workers in fossil fuel supply industries receive training to take up new\n\njobs in low-carbon industries, at a cost of $11,000 per worker (EU-based\n\nestimates), whereas other sectors will also invest in training for 10% of\n\ntheir workforce to adapt to a low-carbon environment, at the cost of\n\n$1650 per worker for manufacturing industries and $550 per worker in\n\nother sectors (Vandeplas et. al., 2022). The number of fossil fuel supply\n\nworkers receiving training is determined by the number of jobs at risk\n\nof being displaced by the transition. The total cost of training per year\n\nis determined by the number of workers receiving training multiplied by\n\nthe average cost of training. In addition, 20% of all 15-24 years-olds in the region will receive higher\n\neducation or vocational training at the cost of $1600 per person (based\n\non the training gap in Arab regions and average cost of training in\n\nEgypt) (Dailynews Egypt, 2019).

ABREGE\n\nu lendemain de la révolution, la Tunisie s’est\n\nengagée dans une transition politique complexe\n\nqui a été marquée par des revers et n’est pas encore achevée, mais qui a également permis au pays d’étre célébré comme la seule réussite démocratique du printemps arabe de 2011. Ces événements ont également entrainé un changement de politique économique. Pour répondre aux demandes sur le plan social qui, avec le désir de liberté politique, avaient déclenché le soulévement, les politiques économiques sont devenues plus inclusives et plus consensuelles. Le recrutement dans le secteur public a été élargi et les salaires publics ont été augmentés, tandis que les transferts publics, notamment le Programme National d’Aide aux Familles Nécessiteuses et Paccés a l’assurance maladie a prix réduit, ont été rapidement étendus. Malgré cela, le moteur de la croissance économique a commencé 4 s’essouffler et, depuis, il est resté lent par rapport aux autres pays a revenu comparable, notamment en raison des incertitudes attribuables en partie aux incidents de sécurité qui ont eu des répercussions sur le retour des touristes. Le modéle axé sur l’exportation, fondé sur des activités manufacturiéres et touristiques peu technologiques, qui étaient le principal moteur de l’économie avant la révolution, s’est retrouvé confronté a un fort ralentissement. Labsence de progrés sur la voie des réformes structurelles a contribué a la détérioration de l’environnement des entreprises, lequel est devenu moins propice aux investissements. Les inégalités géographiques entre les zones rurales et urbaines ainsi qu’entre les régions intérieures et c6tiéres ont persisté. Les chiffres du marché du travail ont parfois été moroses. C’est pourquoi les taux de participation au marché du travail sont étonnamment bas, en particulier chez les femmes. La création d’emplois est faible, les diplomés universitaires continuent d’étre confrontés a des taux de chémage élevés et une grande partie des travailleurs sont employés de maniére informelle. Parallélement, Paugmentation des dépenses publiques, principalement attribuable a la hausse de la masse salariale, a fait grimper le déficit budgétaire qui, combiné a un déficit croissant de la balance courante, a mis en évidence la non-viabilité du modéle de développement économique. Puis est arrivée la pandémie de COVID-19, qui a aggravé les perspectives\n\néconomiques et exacerbé les déséquilibres existants. Aujourd’hui, la Tunisie est confrontée a une croissance ) >\n\néconomique limitée, 4 des déficits budgétaires et de sa balance courante, et aux chiffres du marché du travail\n\n>\n\njugés insatisfaisants pour la majorité de la population et qui viennent alimenter un sentiment de frustration. Il est donc important d’identifier les éléments responsables des performances médiocres du marché du travail afin de\n\npouvoir déterminer les leviers politiques clés 4 actionner. Le présent rapport fait valoir que la raison premiére de la médiocrité de la performance de l’emploi est la croissance économique de faible intensité — une caractéristique constante de la décennie qui a suivi la révolution de 2011. Vélasticité élevée entre l'emploi et la croissance observée dans la période postrévolutionnaire, laquelle est bien supérieure a la moyenne des pays a revenu intermédiaire, indique qu’un taux de croissance économique légérement plus élevé aurait généré un taux de création d’emplois tout aussi élevé. Il convient toutefois de signaler qu’environ 20 % de l’emploi net ajouté au cours de la période 2011-17 est imputable a l’expansion de l’emploi dans le secteur public ainsi que dans les services de santé et d’enseignement, et donc que cela n’est potentiellement pas une voie durable\n\na moyen terme. Létude met en évidence plusieurs faits stylisés résumés ci-dessous et développés dans la suite de l’abrégé. Le rapport principal présente une analyse complete de la situation. Tout d’abord, moins d’une personne en Age de travailler sur deux participe activement au marché du travail, c’est-a-dire qu’elle est soit employée, soit a la recherche d’un emploi. Le capital humain de la Tunisie est donc fortement sous- exploité, et les investissements publics dans l’enseignement qui ont permis d’améliorer considérablement ce domaine au cours des derniéres décennies ne se transforment pas en occasions d’embauche. Deux groupes en particulier se distinguent par leurs faibles taux de participation et\n\nd’emploi : les femmes et les jeunes. Dans le cas des femmes, malgré certaines améliorations apportées par des jeunes diplémés de l’enseignement supérieur, leur participation reste, en moyenne, extrémement faible. La faiblesse de la demande de main-d’ceuvre, la division\n\nsexuelle des réles assignés par la société aux hommes\n\net aux femmes et l’insuffisance de l’offre de services de garde d’enfants abordables sont des facteurs plausibles de la persistance de la faible participation des femmes au marché du travail. Par ailleurs, l’'ampleur de l’écart de rémunération entre hommes et femmes dans le secteur privé (qui se traduit chez les femmes par |’équivalent de prés de trois mois de travail effectué gratuitement sur une année) contribue au faible taux de participation des femmes. Cette grande différence de salaire horaire entre les hommes et les femmes est susceptible de constituer une incitation économique (dans le cadre de discussions entre conjoints) et de pousser les femmes a assumer la majeure partie des taches ménagéres et familiales pendant que leurs maris travaillent, ce qui contribue a renforcer la division sexuelle des rdles assignés par la société aux hommes et aux femmes. Dans le cas des jeunes, au cours de la derniére décennie, le chémage est resté un probléme grave et constant parmi les diplomés universitaires. La lenteur de la création d’emplois a forte rémunération est Pune des principales raisons du taux de chémage élevé chez les jeunes diplémés de l’enseignement supérieur, ainsi que de l’inadéquation des compétences, car les filiéres choisies par de nombreux jeunes ne correspondent pas a la demande du secteur privé, mais sont plutét adaptées au profil des fonctionnaires. Mais surtout, l’écart salarial important entre les dipl6més universitaires employés dans le secteur public et ceux employés dans le secteur privé est presque entiérement attribuable aux caractéristiques intrinséques des jeunes. Un jeune Tunisien titulaire d’un diplome universitaire et employé dans le secteur public ne gagne pas, en moyenne, un salaire plus élevé par rapport a un jeune doté des mémes caractéristiques et travaillant dans le secteur privé. Pourtant, les emplois du secteur public sont associés 4 des avantages supplémentaires, tels que la sécurité de l’emploi, des augmentations de salaire garanties, des indemnités, un large éventail de possibilités de congés annuels, un long congé de maternité et des horaires de travail flexibles, qui peuvent rendre ces emplois plus attrayants, en particulier pour les femmes. En outre, de nombreux diplémés universitaires au chOmage peuvent se permettre de patienter tout en vivant chez leurs parents. En outre, les politiques du marché du travail en vigueur consistent en des subventions salariales qui engendrent des possibilités d’embauche temporaires aux bénéficiaires au prix d’effets d’aubaine et de substitution importants, mais qui ne débouchent pas sur davantage de perspectives\n\nd’embauche a long terme. Deuxiémement, une part importante des travailleurs\n\nsont employés de maniére informelle, c’est-a-dire quils\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nn’ont pas accés a l’assurance sociale ou qu’ils exploitent des entreprises non constituées en société qui ne sont pas enregistrées auprés des autorités fiscales ou autres procédures formelles de comptabilité publique. Parmi les travailleurs salariés, l’informalité est plus répandue chez les hommes, les jeunes et les travailleurs peu instruits des zones rurales et des régions intérieures. Toutefois, si les travailleurs présentant ces profils ont des difficultés a accéder a des emplois dans le secteur public ou a des emplois formels dans le secteur privé et ne sont pas protégés contre les risques couverts par les assurances sociales (tels que les événements de santé, la vieillesse, le chémage et l’invalidité), ils ne subissent pas de pénalités salariales. La majeure partie de l’écart salarial entre les travailleurs salariés formels et informels du secteur privé découle des différences de caractéristiques des\n\ntravailleurs et des emplois. Troisiémement, les retombées économiques de |’éducation sont considérables en Tunisie par rapport aux pays a revenu moyen et élevé. En 2019, les travailleurs ayant achevé leur scolarité primaire ont bénéficié d’une prime denviron 12,6 % par heure travaillée par rapport aux travailleurs qui n’ont pas fait d’études. Lenseignement secondaire a donné lieu a une prime supplémentaire d’environ 9,1 % par rapport a l’enseignement primaire, et l’enseignement supérieur a une prime de 26,1 % par rapport a l’enseignement secondaire. Par ailleurs, les retombées économiques de l’enseignement supérieur sont considérablement plus élevées dans le secteur public et ont augmenté au fil du temps, alors qu’elles ont diminué dans le secteur privé. Cela souléve la question de la pérennité de\n\nla croissance des salaires dans le secteur public. A lexception des faibles taux de participation au marché du travail et des disparités entre les femmes et les hommes, les données signalent des distorsions réduites sur le marché du travail et une élasticité emploi-croissance élevée. Le principal probléme a résoudre pour favoriser la création demplois est donc de savoir pourquoi la croissance économique a été si faible au cours de la derniére décennie. La réponse n’est pas anodine, et de multiples facteurs peuvent entrer en jeu. La majeure partie de la croissance économique récente est due a la hausse de l’emploi ; peu de choses sont liées a la croissance de la productivité du travail. Les gains de productivité du travail plutét modestes sont attribuables en grande partie 4 un déplacement de la main-d’ceuvre des secteurs a productivité inférieure a la moyenne au profit de secteurs a productivité supérieure\n\na la moyenne, plutét qu’a une croissance de la productivité\n\nAbrégé\n\ndu travail au sein des secteurs. Létude avance deux hypothéses complémentaires relatives aux politiques fiscales et réglementaires. Premiérement, le déficit élevé et croissant des comptes budgétaires et courants, généré par la politique budgétaire expansionniste au lendemain de la révolution et par la baisse des exportations et par Paugmentation continue des importations, respectivement, afaitaugmenterlecoatducapital,réduire les investissements, et a détériorer le climat des affaires. Deuxiémement, malgré des taux d’entrée et de sortie élevés, notamment chez les petites entreprises, la taille des entreprises n’augmente pas aprés leur entrée. Le manque de dynamisme dans le secteur privé peut étre imputé a plusieurs facteurs. Un élément clé a trait 4 une contestabilité insuffisante sur le marché. Les entreprises privées « connectées » sur le plan politique et les entreprises d’Etat ne répondent a aucune logique defficacité, car elles sont protégées de la concurrence, de l’imposition de tarifs douaniers, des limites imposées aux investissements directs étrangers et du contréle des prix en vertu du soutien direct et du financement garanti par I’Etat. Ces effets ne se limitent pas aux marchés sur lesquels opérent les entreprises favorisées ; ils s’étendent aux marchés en amont et en aval, ce qui freine encore la\n\ncroissance de la productivité et la création d’emplois. Lanalyse présentée dans le rapport tire parti de plusieurs sources de données produites par |’Institut national de la statistique (INS) de Tunisie, notamment des fichiers de données consultables par le grand public, des fichiers de données a usage restreint et des rapports publiés par INS sur la base des enquétes sur les microentreprises et du registre national des entreprises. Lanalyse n’aurait pas été possible sans le travail de collecte des données et l’excellent soutien et le concours de l’INS. Lanalyse des salaires est un exemple parfait de collaboration et montre l’importance de produire, d’analyser et de diffuser des données pour mieux comprendre les tendances et les caractéristiques des chiffres du marché du travail et, donc, l’évolution du niveau de vie. Létude témoigne du travail assidu de PINS dans la grande fréquence de la collecte de données d’enquétes et constitue un plaidoyer pour continuer sur la voie vertueuse du renforcement de la production et de la diffusion de données et de statistiques. Il est essentiel dutiliser des données en plus grand nombre, de grande\n\nqualité et faciles d’accés si ’on veut pouvoir éclairer\n\nle débat public et élaborer des politiques sur la base de\n\ndonnées probantes. Le rapport souligne certains domaines qui méritent des études plus approfondies. Une analyse en profondeur du lien entre le degré de contestabilité des marchés de produits et le manque de dynamisme au niveau des entreprises, qui semblent étre un facteur clé de la faible croissance économique du pays, pourrait permettre de mettre en lumiére les leviers politiques nécessaires a actionner pour promouvoir la croissance des entreprises et la création d’emplois. Cela pourrait également favoriser une plus grande participation et un meilleur taux d’embauche chez les femmes et les jeunes. Il faudra pour cela avoir accés aux microdonnées du registre national des entreprises et aux enquétes au niveau des entreprises. Le fait d’évaluer importance des facteurs spécifiques qui compliquent la transition entre |’école et le monde du travail, notamment l’inadéquation des compétences, la qualité de l’enseignement et de la formation, les réglementations du travail et les politiques du marché du travail en vigueur, peut aider les décideurs a hiérarchiser et a adapter les mesures visant a réduire le nombre de personnes qui ne sont ni en emploi, ni aux études, ni en formation (NEET) et a faciliter entrée et le maintien sur le marché du travail des diplémés universitaires. Afin de réaliser ces analyses approfondies, il faudra obtenir des données de |’Enquéte Nationale sur Emploi, des données administratives provenant d’établissements d’enseignement universitaire et de formation technique et professionnelle, ainsi que des institutions et des ministéres de tutelle responsables des politiques en vigueur en matiére de marché du travail. Les améliorations modestes de la participation des femmes au marché du travail et la persistance des importantes disparités du niveau d’études nous appellent a préter attention aux facteurs susceptibles daccroitre leur taux de participation, tels que les services de garde d’enfants, la division sexuelle des rédles assignés par la société aux hommes et aux femmes, les barriéres culturelles et les préférences pour certains types de travail. Les données de l’Enquéte Nationale sur |’Emploi, les données administratives sur les structures d’accueil des enfants et la collecte de microdonnées ad hoc sur les réles, les préférences et les barriéres culturelles permettraient\n\nd’étayer ce programme de recherche. INTRODUCTION\n\nomprendre le lien entre la transformation écono-\n\nmique, la croissance et l’emploi est la clé du dével-\n\noppement économique, en particulier dans les pays a revenu intermédiaire. Tout d’abord, il faut rappeler que la croissance économique est nécessaire a la création d’emplois ainsi qu’a l’augmentation des revenus du travail, donc a l’amélioration du niveau de vie. Dans les pays a revenu intermédiaire dont la transformation économique est plus avancée, les transferts de main-d’ceuvre entre secteurs d’activité sont moins pertinents pour la croissance économique, tandis que les gains de productivité au sein d’un méme secteur sont d’une importance capitale. Un plus grand nombre de personnes travaillent généralement pour un salaire, par opposition aux travailleurs a leur compte ou aux travailleurs familiaux collaborant a Pentreprise familiale. De plus, les travailleurs sont en moyenne plus instruits et sont susceptibles d’obtenir des salaires d’acceptation élevés, c’est pourquoi un faible taux de participation au marché du travail et des taux de chémage élevés constituent généralement des défis plus conséquents dans un tel contexte. $’il est vrai qu’un secteur privé florissant est essentiel pour créer des emplois plus nombreux et de meilleure qualité, la croissance économique 4 elle seule ne suffit pas si la demande du type de travail que la population active d’un pays peut fournir n’augmente pas. En outre, pour que la croissance économique se traduise par des emplois plus inclusifs, il faut supprimer les obstacles a la participation économique ainsi que les distorsions sur le marché du travail, du crédit et des produits qui favorisent un groupe d’initiés, souvent\n\n« connectés » sur le plan politique. Lobjectif du présent rapport est de fournir un diagnostic complet de ’emploi qui peut éclairer les politiques visant a générer des emplois plus nombreux, de meilleure qualité et plus inclusifs. Le rapport illustre les caractéristiques, les contraintes et la dynamique du marché du travail tunisien au cours des 15 derniéres années et offre une description des dynamiques de l’offre et de la demande qui déterminent les chiffres du marché du travail, en accordant une attention particuliére aux changements observés avant et aprés la révolution de Jasmin de 2011, aux disparités géographiques entre les régions cétiéres et intérieures, et aux évolutions du marché du travail aprés l’apparition de la pandémie de COVID-19. Lanalyse n’aurait pas été possible sans le travail de collecte des données, l’excellent soutien et le concours de PINS. Lanalyse présentée dans le rapport tire parti de plusieurs sources de données produites par INS de Tunisie, notamment des fichiers de données consultables par le grand public, des fichiers de données a usage restreint et des rapports publiés par |’Institut sur la base des enquétes sur les microentreprises et du registre national des entreprises. Létude témoigne du travail assidu du personnel de INS dans sa fréquence de collecte de données d’enquétes et constitue un appel a continuer sur la voie vertueuse du renforcement de la production et de la diffusion de données et de statistiques. Il est essentiel d’utiliser une grande quantité de données de grande qualité et facilement accessibles si Pon veut pouvoir éclairer le débat public et élaborer des\n\npolitiques sur la base de données probantes. Le rapport est structuré en quatre chapitres. Le chapitre 1\n\ndécrit les tendances en matiére de croissance, de productivité, de démographie, d’emploi et de niveau de vie afin d’éclairer analyse de l’offre et de la demande de main-d’ceuvre effectuée dans les chapitres suivants. Le chapitre commence par décrire les tendances globales de la croissance économique et du niveau de vie de la population tunisienne, les moteurs de la croissance (par exemple, les transferts de fonds et les migrations, les IDE, le taux de change, la productivité, etc.) et les vastes changements structurels en termes de création d’emplois et de croissance de la productivité du travail. Le chapitre 2 propose une vue d’ensemble de la composition du marché du travail et de son évolution au fil du temps, notamment des données démographiques et sur la participation au marché du travail, l’emploi et la composition de l’emploi en termes de type d’emploi, de secteur industriel, de profession, tant au niveau global que pour différents groupes de population, sur la base du genre, de l’age, du niveau de scolarité et de la situation géographique. Il se concentre sur deux groupes qui rencontrent particuliérement des difficultés pour intégrer le marché du travail, 4 savoir les femmes et les jeunes, et avance des hypothéses concernant les principaux obstacles a cette intégration. Le chapitre 3 met l’accent sur l’une des dimensions les plus pertinentes qui caractérisent le marché du travail tunisien, 4 savoir la distinction entre le secteur public, ’emploi formel et ’emploi informel. Le chapitre\n\nétudie la corrélation entre les caractéristiques individuelles\n\net la probabilité de travailler dans différents types d’emploi ; il donne une vue d’ensemble des tendances récentes des salaires et des écarts salariaux conditionnels selon un certain nombre de paramétres (hommes/femmes, secteurs public/privé, emploi formel/informel) ; et il illustre la fagon dont les travailleurs salariés ayant des caractéristiques différentes, en particulier des niveaux de scolarité différents, bénéficient du marché du travail. Enfin, en s’appuyant\n\nsur les conclusions du chapitre 1, le chapitre 4 examine\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nles tendances récentes des modéles de transformation structurelle et spatiale dans la dimension de l’emploi et des entreprises. I] fournit une vue d’ensemble du paysage des entreprises ventilée selon la taille, le secteur industriel et la zone géographique, ainsi que les tendances récentes des entreprises en matiére de performances, de dynamique, de décisions autour du travail et d’investissements en capital, mais aussi les contraintes et les opportunités auxquelles elles sont confrontées. fot N 3\n\nCroissance économique, transformation structurelle et emploi\n\nPOINTS CLES\n\n™ Lacroissance économique récente a été mitigée, car le développement économique de la Tunisie s‘est recemment orienté vers un modéle moins durable qui a remplacé les investissements et les exportations par la demande intérieure\n\n®™ La réduction de la pauvreté s’est poursuivie en grande partie grace a |’expansion des transferts publics\n\n™ La croissance économique a été poussée surtout par les gains de productivité du travail avant la\n\nrévolution et par la création d’emplois par la suite\n\n= Dans les années qui ont précédé la révolution, les gains de productivité du travail se sont produits sur les marchés de monopoles ou non contestables dominés par les sociétés publiques et dans ‘administration publique par l’augmentation rapide des dépenses publiques (les salaires). ® Au lendemain de la révolution, bien que la création d’emplois soit devenue le principal moteur de la croissance économique, elle n‘a pas suffi a repondre a |’augmentation de la population active, en particulier auprés des diplémés universitaires. = Bien que la transformation structurelle ait contribué a la croissance de la productivité du travail entre 2011 et 2017, elle ne pourra soutenir la croissance économique a I‘avenir que si le capital et l'efficacité parviennent a augmenter dans les secteurs dont la productivité du travail est supérieure\n\na la moyenne et ayant pu attirer davantage de travailleurs\n\nCroissance, réduction de la pauvreté et création d’emplois\n\na croissance de la Tunisie a toujours été comparable\n\na celle des économies de cette région du monde et du\n\ngroupe de revenu. Au cours de la période 1981-2000, la croissance économique a affiché une moyenne de 4,2 % par an en Tunisie, 3,8 % dans la région MENA (a l’exclusion des pays a revenu élevé) et 4,1 % dans les pays a revenu intermédiaire (tranches inférieure et supérieure). Aprés avoir pris en compte les différences quant a la croissance de la population, la performance historique de la Tunisie, estimée a 2,4 pour cent par an en moyenne entre 1981 et 2000, surpasse celle des pays de la région (1,4 pour cent) et des groupes de revenus de comparaison (2,1 pour cent et 2,8 pour cent parmi les pays a revenu moyen/tranche inférieure\n\net a tranche supérieure, respectivement) (Tableau 1.1). Depuis la révolution de Jasmin de janvier 2011, la croissance économique s’est affaiblie. La croissance économique, mesurée par la croissance moyenne annuelle du produit intérieur brut (PIB) par habitant, s’est essoufflée par rapport a la tendance historique du pays et aux pays de la région et groupes de revenus de comparaison (voir Tableau 1.1). La croissance en demie teinte de la Tunisie aprés son arrivée dans le groupe des pays a revenu intermédiaire/tranche supérieure en 2010 a renvoyé le pays dans le groupe des pays a revenu intermédiaire/tranche inférieure cinq ans plus tard. En 2019, le PIB par habitant était estimé a 10 756 dollars (mesuré en parité de pouvoir d’achat [PPP], cours de 2017), contre une moyenne des pays de la région (a Pexclusion des pays a haut revenu) de 10 172 dollars. (Graphique 1.1). La pandémie de COVID-19 et le ralentissement économique ont encore aggravé les perspectives économiques. Le PIB de la Tunisie a diminué de 8,8 % en 2020, la plus\n\nforte réduction ayant été observée dans le secteur des\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nservices, notamment dans les activités d’hébergement et de restauration et dans les transports (Graphique 1.2). Les données trimestrielles de Institut national de la Statistique (INS) indiquent que le PIB a accusé une forte baisse au deuxiéme trimestre de 2020, suite 4 la mise en place d’un confinement a l’échelle du pays (-21,3 %). Léconomie a continué a subir les effets du ralentissement mondial aux troisiéme et quatriéme trimestres (respectivement —5,7 % et —6,1 % par rapport aux mémes trimestres de 2019). En 2020, le PIB par habitant est estimé 4 9 728 dollars (mesuré en PPA de 2017). Les estimations pour le deuxiéme trimestre de 2021 indiquent une augmentation de 16,2 % par rapport au méme trimestre de 2020, grace aux activités d’hébergement et de restauration, au textile, au raffinage du pétrole et au secteur du batiment. Au troisiéme trimestre de 2021, économie a enregistré une faible augmentation (0,3 %) par rapport au méme trimestre de 2020, la\n\ncroissance de la plupart des secteurs ayant faibli. La croissance économique modeste n’a pas suffi a suivre Vaugmentation de la population active, en particulier des diplémés universitaires. Sur la période 2006-17, l'économie a créé des emplois a un taux annualisé de 1,4 %, en moyenne (Graphique 1.3). Sur la méme période, la population active a augmenté de 1,7 % par an et le nombre de personnes en Age de travailler a augmenté de 1,2 % par an. Cela signifie que la Tunisie a connu, en moyenne, un déficit net d’emploi d’environ 18 000 postes par an. Les chiffres de ensemble cachent d’importantes différences selon le niveau de scolarité. La création d’emplois chez les Tunisiens jamais scolarisés ou ayant achevé leur scolarité primaire a été plus rapide que leur entrée dans la vie active, ce qui a contribué a la baisse du taux de chmage chez les personnes peu diplémées (Graphique 1.4). En revanche, l’emploi des Tunisiens ayant fait des études secondaires et, surtout, supérieures, n’a pas été suffisant pour suivre l’augmentation de leur nombre dans les rangs de la population active, ce qui a affecté les dipl6més\n\nuniversitaires de maniére disproportionnée.

Vélasticité entre l'emploi et la croissance a augmenté depuis la révolution, en grande partie grace a l’industrie manufacturiére, au tourisme et aux autres services. Estimé 40,9 % avant la révolution, le taux de croissance annualisé de l'emploi s’est accéléré pour atteindre 1,6 % en 2011-17. Vélasticité de l’emploi a la croissance, qui permet de mesurer l’augmentation de l’emploi pour chaque hausse de 1 point de pourcentage de la croissance du PIB, est passée de 0,28 point de pourcentage sur la période 2006-11 a 0,89 sur la période 2011-17 (Graphique 1.5). C’est pourquoi un point de pourcentage de croissance est lié a une hausse de l’emploi de 0,9 point de pourcentage. Cette élasticité est plus élevée par rapport aux chiffres historiques de la Tunisie (0,61 et 0,57 point de pourcentage pour les périodes 1980-89 et 1990-99, respectivement), au groupe de revenu des pays d’Afrique du Nord (0,35 point de pourcentage sur la période 2011-17) et aux estimations mondiales (0,51 et 0,3 point de pourcentage sur la période 1999-2003, respectivement), ainsi qu’aux estimations des pays de comparaison (a l’exception de la Jordanie) (Graphique 1.6).'

En 2015, prés de 26 % de la population des zones rurales était pauvre, contre 10 % dans les zones urbaines (voir Graphique 1.9). Les écarts régionaux sont également considérables. Une carte de la pauvreté récemment réalisée indique que le taux de pauvreté est élevé dans les régions du Centre- Ouest (30,8 %) et du Nord-Ouest (28,4 %) de la Tunisie (Banque mondiale et INS 2020). Bien que l’incidence dans les régions cétiéres — région du Grand Tunis (5,3 %), Nord-Est (11,6 %) et Centre-Est (11,5 % — était faible\n\n5La moyenne pour la région MENA est basée sur les dernigres données 4 notre disposition pour les économies suivantes : Algérie (2011), Djibouti (2013), République arabe d’E-gypte (2015), République islamique d’Iran (2015), Irak (2012), Israél (2014), Jordanie (2010), Maroc (2013), Syrie (2004), Tunisie (2015), Cisjordanie et Gaza (2011) et Yémen (2014). par rapport au reste du pays, quelques districts affichaient une incidence relativement élevée. De méme, les écarts géographiques persistent sur le plan des inégalités. Une grande partie de l’inégalité est due aux disparités entre les zones urbaines et rurales et d’une région a l'autre. A partir de 2015, dans les zones urbaines, l’indice de Gini était estimé a 35,0, tandis que, dans les zones rurales, il était de\n\n31,9, et Pécart s’est creusé au fil du temps. L’accélération du rythme de réduction de la pauvreté entre 2010 et 2015 semble étre en grande partie liée a une expansion des transferts publics. Etant donné que les ménages a faible revenu dépendent fortement des transferts publics (69 % du revenu des ménages en 2014), a savoir les pensions et l’aide sociale (Krafft et Davis 2021), ces transferts ont un impact considérable sur les conditions de vie des plus démunis par rapport aux autres sources de revenus. Au lendemain de la révolution, la Tunisie a renforcé le programme de transferts monétaires, connu sous le nom de Programme National d’Aide aux Familles Nécessiteuses. Le nombre de ménages bénéficiaires a augmenté de fagon spectaculaire, passant de 176 000 en 2011 a 234 000 en 2015, et le montant du transfert a été porté de 72 TD en 2010 a 150 TD en 2015 (en termes réels) (CRES, ADB, et ADF 2017). En outre, une assurance maladie a prix réduit (AMG2) a été fournie a un nombre croissant de ménages vulnérables, et de généreuses subventions a la consommation ont continué a protéger le pouvoir d’achat. Une seconde voie aurait pu contribuer a sortir certains ménages de la pauvreté. La composition de l’emploi a considérablement changé avec\n\nla transition de sortie de l’agriculture et ’augmentation de\n\n13\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nGRAPHIQUE 1.11.

Les différences entre les zones urbaines et rurales au sein des régions s’expliquent en grande partie par les écarts de dotations. Les écarts entre le Grand Tunis et les autres zones urbaines sont également imputables a des dotations différentes, sauf pour les régions du Nord- Est, du Centre-Est et du Sud-Ouest, ot les résultats jouent un réle non négligeable. Les écarts entre les zones rurales des régions en téte (Nord-Est, Centre-Est et Grand Tunis) et celles accusant un retard sont en grande partie attribuables aux retombées économiques. Les efforts déployés pour améliorer les caractéristiques productives des régions accusant un retard ainsi que des populations\n\nrurales sont donc essentiels pour continuer a relever\n\n7On peut utiliser la décomposition de Oaxaca-Blinder pour estimer les différences de revenus d’une région 4 l’autre et entre les zones urbaines et rurales et en comprendre les principales composantes (Blinder 1973 ; Oaxaca 1973). La premiére étape consiste a estimer les équations de consommation exprimée en logarithme en fonction d’un ensemble de caractéristiques du ménage, notamment |’age du chef de famille, sa situation matrimoniale, son niveau de scolarité, sa situation d’activité et son secteur d’emploi, la taille du ménage, la structure démographique du ménage (part des membres du ménage dans différentes tranches d’age), la structure scolarisée du ménage (part des membres du ménage ayant un niveau de scolarité différent), la principale source de chauffage du logement, la principale source d’eau potable et la distance au centre de santé le plus proche et au centre commercial le plus proche.

Il s’agit notamment d’élargir l’accés aux services de base et aux services de santé et d’éducation de qualité. Il est possible de réduire les écarts entre les zones urbaines et rurales de différentes régions par la mise en ceuvre d’une combinaison de politiques visant a améliorer les caractéristiques des populations locales et de mesures visant 4 améliorer la connectivité de ces zones. Les politiques visant a encourager les activités économiques et la création d’emplois dans les zones accusant un retard au moyen d’incitations fiscales et financiéres n’ont pas fait leurs preuves dans d’autres pays. Lexpérience tunisienne met également en évidence le manque de succés du recours aux incitations pour réduire les disparités régionales (Banque mondiale 2014). Transformation économique et sources de croissance\n\nLa croissance économique a été de plus en plus tirée par la consommation, tandis que la contribution du commerce et des investissements s’est estompée. Au cours des deux derniéres décennies, la consommation publique et privée a gagné en importance dans la croissance du PIB (Tableau 1.3), ce qui implique une évolution de |’économie vers une voie de développement économique moins durable, par opposition a une croissance tirée par des facteurs durables,\n\ntels que l’investissement et le commerce.

Le secteur extérieur, en particulier les exportations, est faible depuis la crise financiére de 2008 et les troubles politiques de 2011. Bien que toutes les composantes de la demande globale aient récemment diminué, la chute des exportations a été particuli¢rement conséquente.

Au cours des deux derniéres décennies, la croissance des exportations (en volume) a été médiocre ; seule l’Indonésie est moins bien classée que la Tunisie (Graphique 1.14). En revanche, les envois de fonds ont oscillé autour de 4,5 % du PIB au cours des deux derniéres décennies. Les recettes du tourisme ont diminué avec lincertitude politique déclenchée par la révolution de 2011 ainsi qu’avec impact des incidents touchant a la sécurité.

Les entreprises exportatrices peuvent également stimuler la croissance de la productivité, car elles sont exposées\n\na la concurrence internationale. Les exportations sont devenues de plus en plus diverses et complexes, mais leurs retombées sur le reste de l’économie sont limitées. Vespace des produits exportés est devenu plus diversifié et plus complexe au fil du temps (Graphique 1.15). La Tunisie se classe au 46e rang dans l’indice de complexité économique (ICE), ce qui représente une amélioration de 8 places au cours de la derniére décennie et ne la laisse derriére que les pays de référence cibles. Et pourtant, Péconomie ne profite pas pleinement de l’ouverture commerciale. Les entreprises du secteur offshore bénéficient d’exonérations et de réductions fiscales ainsi que de procédures administratives simplifiées, mais n’ont qu’un lien limité avec le reste de l'économie, ce quia des implications sur les plans de l’'ampleur des transferts technologiques et de la création d’emplois. Les investissements structurellement faibles ont encore diminué au cours de la derniére décennie. Les faibles performances économiques récentes de la Tunisie s’accompagnent d’un faible niveau d’investissement. Dans les années 1990 et au cours de la premiére décennie des\n\nannées 2000, les investissements ont oscillé autour de\n\n24 % du PIB (Graphique 1.16). Depuis la révolution, les investissements publics et privés ont entamé une baisse réguliére pour atteindre 18 % du PIB en 2019. Ce chiffre est inférieur a la moyenne des pays de la région et groupes de revenus de comparaison, laquelle était estimée 4 28,6 % et 21,9 %, respectivement, en 2019 (Graphique 1.17). Les investissements en Tunisie sont également inférieurs aux niveaux observés chez les pays de référence structurels et cibles, a exception de la Jordanie (Graphique 1.17). Plus des deux tiers des investissements étaient concentrés dans le secteur des services, qui était protégé de la concurrence\n\ninternationale (Graphique 1.18). Les flux d’investissements directs étrangers (IDE) ont perdu de leur dynamisme, mais ils se sont progressivement orientés vers le secteur manufacturier. Par rapport aux pays de la région et groupes de revenus de comparaison, les flux d’IDE représentaient une part importante du PIB (environ 3,8 %) avant la crise de 2008. Les entrées d’IDE ont repris pour atteindre 2,1 % du PIB en 2019, bien en dega des niveaux de la premiére décennie des années 2000 (Graphique 1.13). Alors que, par le passé, les flux d’IDE étaient principalement destinés au secteur de |’énergie (et, certaines années, aux télécommunications), ils se sont partiellement déplacés vers le secteur manufacturier, ce qui est essentiel pour la croissance, l’emploi et les exportations (Graphique 1.19).

Le déficit de la balance courante restera un sujet de préoccupation, car celle-ci refléte le taux d’épargne net de |’économie, et les déficits\n\nne sont pas viables a long terme. De plus, la situation budgétaire de la Tunisie s’est consi- dérablement détériorée. Le déficit budgétaire s’est accru, passant d’une moyenne de -2,4 % du PIB sur la période 2000-10 a -5 % du PIB en moyenne sur la période 2011-19, en raison de dépenses récurrentes élevées, notamment la masse salariale publique, les subventions a |’énergie et a Palimentation, et les transferts aux sociétés publiques (voir Graphique 1.21). Les dépenses récurrentes sont passées de 17,9 % du PIB en 2010 a 21,4 % du PIB en 2011 et ont continué a augmenter, atteignant 25,4 % du PIB en 2013, avant de diminuer légérement, a 24,7 % du PIB en 2017 (Banque mondiale et BAD 2020). Le ralentissement économique déclenché par la pandémie de COVID-19 et lintervention fiscale ont fait augmenter le déficit budgétaire et la dette publique en 2020. Selon le Fonds monétaire international (FMI), le déficit budgétaire (hors subventions) est estimé 4 11,5 % du PIB, et la dette de l’administration centrale a augmenté pour atteindre 87,6 % du PIB en 2020, toujours selon les estimations. La masse salariale des fonctionnaires est l’une des plus élevées au monde, absorbant prés de 50 % des dépenses publiques et 15 % du PIB. Lexpansion des dépenses publiques a permis de relever le défi de l’insécurité et\n\ndes revendications sociales qui ont suivi la révolution de\n\n2011. Avec la loi de 2012 favorisant l’accés a l’administration publique des blessés de la révolution et des personnes couvertes par l’'amnistie de 2011, les embauches dans le secteur public et les salaires des fonctionnaires ont consi- dérablement augmenté (Brockmeyer, Khatrouch et Raballand 2015 ; INS 2017 ; OCDE 2018). La masse salariale est passée de 10,5 % du PIB en 2000 4 14,6 % du PIB en 2019, et on estime qu’elle a atteint 17,6 % du PIB en 2020, suite aux embauches supplémentaires dans le secteur public (dont environ 4 sur 10 dans le secteur de la santé), ainsi qu’aux augmentations de salaires (FMI 2021). En 2020, ce niveau était environ deux fois supérieur 4 la médiane de 8,7 % du PIB des marchés en développement non producteurs de pétrole, chiffre qui place la Tunisie au premier rang des marchés en développement non producteurs de pétrole (FMI 2021). Cette masse salariale pléthorique exclut d’autres dépenses publiques. En 2020, elle a consommé environ 75 % des recettes fiscales, et elle représentait également prés de trois fois l’ampleur des investissements publics et prés de six fois le montant des dépenses consacrées\n\naux programmes sociaux (FMI 2021). Le double déficit n’est pas viable 4 long terme. Les soldes budgétaires reflétent le taux d’épargne net du secteur public, et les soldes des comptes courants reflétent le taux d’épargne net de l’ensemble de l'économie (Arezki et coll. 2019). La dette publique de la Tunisie risque de devenir insoutenable 4 moyen terme si un certain nombre de réformes visant a réduire le déficit budgétaire ne sont pas adoptées, notamment en diminuant la masse\n\nsalariale publique, en réduisant les subventions a |’énergie,\n\n19\n\n20\n\nen renforgant le ciblage des dépenses de protection sociale et en rendant le systéme fiscal plus efficace et plus équitable. La corrélation positive qui existe en Tunisie entre le compte courant et le déficit budgétaire souléve la question de la viabilité du premier, en particulier dans les situations ow le second est motivé par des dépenses qui n’ont pas de grands effets multiplicateurs. La croissance économique récente a été entravée par des gains modestes de la productivité totale des facteurs (PTF). Avant la révolution, l’accumulation du capital et du travail contribuait en moyenne a 45 % et 25 % de la croissance, respectivement (Graphique 1.22). Les 30 % restants de la croissance peuvent étre attribués a des améliorations de la PTF. Depuis 2010, le réle de Paccumulation du capital a augmenté pour atteindre 95 % ; le travail a continué a représenter environ 25 %, tandis que la PTF a eu un effet négatif sur la croissance (-20 %). Bien que les niveaux soient faibles, l’expansion des investissements et de l’emploi représente de plus en plus la majeure partie de la croissance, ce qui indique la présence de failles dans l'économie. Lorsqu’on tient compte des variables du capital humain, on constate que la contribution du capital, du travail et du capital humain est estimée a 56, 15 et 9 pour cent, respectivement. La Tunisie a la plus faible contribution totale du travail a la croissance économique parmi les pays de comparaison (Graphique 1.23).

De sorte que les capitaux sont susceptibles de ne pas aller aux secteurs les plus productifs de l’économie. Elle peut aussi résulter d’une inefficacité technique, c’est-a-dire dune faible capacité a convertir les facteurs de production en rendements productifs.? Le taux d’accumulation du capital a ralenti récemment, et le capital par travailleur a augmenté a un rythme plus faible depuis 2011. La tendance du ratio incrémentiel de production de capital indique que les investissements en capital ont une efficacité décroissante et produisent des rendements marginaux (Graphique 1.25). Toutefois, le fait que les investissements privés se soient poursuivis est le signe que le rendement des investissements est resté élevé. Il existe également des distorsions de facteurs liées aux barriéres a entrée et a la sortie des entreprises et aux défaillances réglementaires. Les capitaux ne vont pas aux entreprises les plus efficaces.

Sur la période 2000-19, de nombreux pays industrialisés ont enregistré une croissance modeste ou un déclin de la PTE, tandis que de grandes économies en développement comme la Chine, I’Indonésie, le Nigeria, les Philippines et la Fédération de Russie ont affiché une croissance considérable de leur PTF. En outre, la méthodologie adoptée pour élaborer la mesure de la productivité de la PTF utilisée dans l’analyse suppose que les parts des facteurs sont constantes entre les pays et au fil du temps.

Si la croissance de la PTF avait été plus élevée, les gains de productivité du travail auraient pu se traduire par une plus forte croissance de la production. Vélasticité entre Pemploi et la croissance n’aurait pas autant d’importance,\n\ncar la croissance de l’emploi serait plus importante. La productivité globale du travail en Tunisie est supérieure a celle de ses pays de référence structurels, mais elle est inférieure a la moyenne des pays de la région en raison d’un secteur secondaire qui accuse un retard. Un autre indicateur de productivité couramment utilisé est la productivité du travail, qui est strictement corrélée a l’évolution du niveau de vie par le biais des salaires. La productivité du travail mesure la valeur ajoutée brute par unité de travail et indique l’efficacité avec laquelle le travail est utilisé dans\n\nla production.!? En Tunisie, la productivité du travail\n\n'°Premiérement, dans ce rapport, la productivité du travail est mesurée en tant que valeur ajoutée brute par travailleur car les informations sur les heures travaillées ne sont pas facilement disponibles. Cela pose probléme si de grands écarts dans les heures de travail existent entre les secteurs et si des changements notables se produisent au fil du temps. Deuxiémement, les variations de la productivité du travail résultent des effets combinés de divers facteurs, notamment l’évolution technologique, l’accumulation de capital, la capacité des travailleurs et l’intensité de leurs efforts ; il peut done étre difficile d’isoler la contribution de chaque composante.

La productivité du secteur agricole tunisien est relativement élevée par rapport aux groupes de revenus de comparaison et aux pays de référence structurels (Graphique 1.26), tout comme la productivité du secteur des services. En revanche, le secteur secondaire tunisien a perdu du terrain et est nettement moins\n\nproductif que dans d’autres pays a revenu intermédiaire.\"! Les écarts de productivité du travail se sont réduits au fil du temps, en grande partie grace aux gains de productivité dans V’agriculture. Les écarts de productivité du travail entre l’agriculture et les autres secteurs sont le moteur du processus de transformation structurelle qui pousse la main- d’ceuvre des secteurs a faible productivité vers les secteurs a forte productivité. En Tunisie, les écarts de productivité du travail se sont réduits au fil du temps (Graphique 1.29). \"Les écarts de productivité décrits ici reflétent les différences de productivité moyenne du travail. Ce qui compte, c’est la productivité marginale du travail qui, dans des marchés fonctionnant bien et sans contraintes, devrait s’équilibrer. Dans une fonction de production Cobb-Douglas, la productivité marginale du travail est égale a la productivité moyenne, multipliée par la part de P’emploi. Ainsi, si la part du travail différe fortement d’un secteur 4 Pautre, la comparaison des productivités moyennes du travail peut étre trompeuse. Par exemple, la productivité moyenne dans le secteur minier est élevée. Cela est probablement di au fait que la part de l'emploi dans la valeur ajoutée de ce secteur a forte intensité de capital est faible. Néanmoins, d’autres secteurs, comme l’agriculture, l'industrie manufacturiére, la construction, administration publique et les services de santé et d’éducation, ont une part d’emploi comparable, et les écarts de productivité moyenne peuvent donc se rapprocher raisonnablement des écarts de productivité marginale. Cette réduction est le sous-produit de trois facteurs : (1) une augmentation rapide de la productivité du travail agricole avant et aprés la révolution (2) une baisse de la productivité dans les secteurs secondaires depuis 2011, et (3) une maigre augmentation de la productivité du travail dans le secteur des services. Le secteur secondaire était en moyenne aussi productif que le secteur des services en 2006, mais ses performances médiocres au fil du temps se sont traduites par une baisse d’environ 15 % par rapport aux services. Les industries au sens large (les industries extractives, les autres industries manufacturiéres et la construction) ont enregistré la plus forte baisse de la production par travailleur, tandis que, dans les services, tous les secteurs, a l’exception de l’hébergement et de la restauration et autres services similaires, étaient plus\n\nproductifs en 2017 par rapport a dix ans auparavant. Bien que le changement structurel ait été lent au cours de la derniére décennie, la Tunisie est en avance sur la moyenne des pays a revenu intermédiaire en termes d’emploi non agricole. Entre 2006 et 2017, la transformation structurelle a progressé a un rythme légérement inférieur a la moyenne des autres pays a revenu intermédiaire.! En 2017, lagriculture représentait 15 % de l’emploi total, contre 19,2 % en 2006 (-4,4 points de pourcentage) (Graphique 1.30).

La part de l’emploi dans le secteur secondaire a légérement augmenté, passant de 32 a 33 % (+1,3 point), ce qui est bien supérieur 4 la moyenne des pays a revenu intermédiaire (20,1 %), et le secteur des services a contribué a 52 % de l’emploi total, contre 48 % en 2006 (+ 3,1 points). Ce dernier chiffre est conforme a la part de 51,9 % des pays a revenu intermédiaire. Dans le secteur secondaire, la part de l’industrie manufacturiére a diminué pour atteindre 18,4 %, bien que certaines industries aient enregistré une augmentation, comme la production de produits agroalimentaires et de produits mécaniques et électriques. La part du secteur de la construction a augmenté d’environ 2 points de pourcentage.

Pourtant, 6 travailleurs sur 10 sont encore employés dans des secteurs dont la productivité est inférieure 4 la moyenne. Les travailleurs sont incités a passer des secteurs a faible productivité du travail aux secteurs a forte productivité du travail tant que les écarts de productivité du travail persistent entre les secteurs et que ces écarts se reflétent dans les salaires versés aux travailleurs. Cependant, les marchés ne sont pas toujours concurrentiels. La productivité du travail peut différer des salaires au sein d’un méme secteur, et les travailleurs peuvent étre confrontés a des obstacles 4 la mobilité entre les secteurs, par exemple parce que Pobtention d’un emploi dans un secteur différent peut impliquer un déménagement dans une autre zone ou exiger un ensemble de compétences complétement différent. En 2017, 60 % des travailleurs tunisiens étaient employés dans des secteurs dont la productivité est inférieure 4 la moyenne (Graphique 1.33). Les secteurs a faible productivité comprennent la construction (13,8 % de l'emploi), Pagriculture (14,8 %), le commerce (13,3 %) et la fabrication (18,4 %).

La croissance économique a été soutenue par les gains de productivité du travail avant la révolution et par la création d’emplois par la suite. Pour déterminer la contribution de la transformation structurelle a la croissance écono- mique, l’analyse a procédé a une décomposition de la croissance du PIB par habitant. La croissance du PIB est décomposée en fonction de la contribution des changements démographiques, de l’emploi et de la productivité du travail (encadré 1.1). Entre 2006 et 2011, la production par travailleur, une mesure de la productivité du travail, a augmenté de prés de 3 % par an. Elle a été le principal moteur de la croissance économique, avec une contribution de 104,6 %. La démographie, représentée par la part de la population en Age de travailler a contribué a hauteur de 20 %. Vemploi a contribué négativement (—24,5 %) a la croissance économique, car la création d’emplois a été inférieure a augmentation de la population en age de travailler (Graphique 1.34). Aprés la révolution (2011-17), les gains de productivité du travail se sont estompés (+0,2 % par an en moyenne), la croissance de\n\nla valeur ajoutée ayant été dépassée par la création d’emplois. Vemploi a augmenté a un taux de 1,7 % par an en moyenne et a contribué a 80,4 % de la croissance économique, devenant ainsi le principal moteur de la croissance. La démographie a eu un effet négatif négligeable sur la croissance, car le nombre de personnes Agées a augmenté plus rapidement que la population en age de travailler (Graphique 1.34). Au cours de cette période, la Tunisie a été le pays dont la contribution de la productivité du travail a la croissance économique a été la plus faible parmi les pays de comparaison (Graphique 1.36). Elle se distingue cependant comme le pays ot la création d’emplois a le plus grand effet positif sur les performances économiques. Les gains d’efficacité dans l'utilisation de la main-d’ceuvre réalisés avant la révolution ont été perdus au profit de Vaugmentation des niveaux d’emploi. Avant 2011, la productivité du travail a augmenté dans de nombreux secteurs, a l’exception de l’hébergement et de la restauration, de la construction, de l’industrie chimique et des autres industries manufacturiéres (Graphique 1.35 panel a). Certains des secteurs qui ont affiché d’importants gains de production par travailleur, tels que les mines, les services financiers et les transports, étaient des secteurs a forte productivité au début de la période, tandis que\n\nd’autres, notamment la fabrication de biens mécaniques,\n\nENCADRE 1.1. Décomposition de Shapley des variations de la valeur ajoutée par habitant\n\nLa méthodologie permet de décomposer la croissance de la valeur ajoutée par habitant en plusieurs étapes consécutives. Pour la premiére étape, la croissance de la valeur ajoutée par habitant est décomposée en variations du taux d’emploi, en variations de la production par travailleur (ou productivité du travail) et en variations démographiques, comme suit (Graphique B 1.1.1) : Y_ Y-ELA SLMS\n\n—=—x—x lt. (B1.1.1) N E A N\n\nY= valeur ajoutée totale ; N = population totale ; E= emploi total ; A= population totale en age de travailler; Y/E = @- >\n\nproduction par travailleur; E/A = e — > part de la population en age de travailler qui est employée; A/N = a- — part de la\n\npopulation totale en age de travailler. Pour la deuxiéme étape, les variations de l'emploi Aesont décomposées en variations de |’emploi par secteur :\n\nAe=))\" Ae. (81.1.2)\n\nLa troisieme étape décompose les variations de la production par travailleur en changements liés aux variations de la production par travailleur au sein des secteurs et en variations liées a la transformation structurelle ou a la réaffectation des travailleurs entre les secteurs de la maniére suivante :\n\nE. Ss\n\nY sy; = —X— ou@= OS, (B1.1.3) E x E E st\n\nE\n\nou (« z } est la production par travailleur dans le secteur i; et d ( } est la part de l'emploi dans le secteur 7. En prenant i\n\nles différences de I’équation B1.1.3 entre l'année finale(¢) et l’année initiale, (t— t)) on obtient ce qui suit :\n\nSs _ Ss _ Aw, =)), FAGie+ DY Asie, (B1.1.4) a Within ‘Structural ‘component transformation\n\not AAg, et Asi,t sont les variations entre les périodes t et (t—1) de la production par travailleur et de la part de l'emploi dans le secteur i, respectivement. Ainsi, les variations de la production par travailleur sont la somme pondérée des variations de la production par travailleur dans tous les secteurs, ot les pondérations sont les parts d'emploi de chaque secteur. Les pondé- rations de chaque secteur sont calculées comme des moyennes sur les deux périodes des parts de l’emploi et des parts de la production par travailleur dans chaque secteur. Une quatriéme étape permet d’aller plus loin dans la compréhension du réle que joue chaque secteur sur |’effet global des transferts d’emplois entre secteurs. L'accroissement de la part de l’emploi dans les secteurs dont la productivité est supérieure a la moyenne augmentera la productivité globale et contribuera positivement au terme de la transformation structurelle. En revanche, les déplacements de la main-d’ceuvre loin des secteurs dont la productivité est supérieure 4 la moyenne auront l’effet inverse. De méme, l‘augmentation de la part de l'emploi dans les secteurs dont la productivité est inférieure a la moyenne réduira la croissance, tandis que la réduction de cette part contribuera positivement 4 la croissance. Si un secteur a une productivité inférieure a la moyenne et que sa part d’emploi diminue, sa contribution sera positive. Ainsi, les sorties de travailleurs de ce secteur a faible productivité auront contribué positivement a l‘augmentation de la production par travailleur. Si ce méme secteur voit sa part d’emploi augmenter, ces afflux de travailleurs dans ce secteur a faible productivité contribueront négativement a la production par travailleur et auront donc un effet négatif sur le plan de la transformation structurelle. L’ampleur de |’effet sera proportionnelle (a) a la différence de productivité du secteur par rapport a la moyenne et (b) a l’ampleur du transfert d’emplois. La derniére étape combine tous les éléments pour calculer la contribution de chaque facteur a la croissance du PIB par habitant. GRAPHIQUE B 1.1.1.

En revanche, au cours de la deuxiéme période (2011-17), la productivité du travail n’a augmenté que dans un petit nombre de secteurs, tandis que Pemploi a progressé de maniére générale, a l’exception des industries textiles et chimiques (Graphique 1.35,- panel b). Dans deux secteurs sur trois ot la production par travailleur a diminué, la baisse est imputable a une croissance plus rapide de ’emploi par rapport a la valeur ajoutée plutét qu’a une baisse de la valeur ajoutée. Les secteurs qui ont enregistré les gains de productivité les plus importants sont tous ceux dont le niveau de productivité était inférieur 4 la moyenne en 2011, a savoir l’agriculture, le commerce et l’administration\n\npublique, ainsi que les services de santé et d’éducation.

Cette étape de la décomposition indique qu’entre 2006 et 2011, la composante intra-secteurs explique la quasi-totalité des gains de productivité. Laugmentation de la production par travailleur a été particuli¢rement élevée dans les secteurs de l’exploitation miniére, des services publics, des services financiers, de ’administration publique, des services de santé et de l’enseignement, de agriculture, de l'industrie manufacturiére et des transports et communications (Graphique 1.37 panel a). Les changements structurels ont exercé un léger effet négatif en raison de la réaffectation de la main-d’ceuvre vers les secteurs a productivité inférieure a la moyenne et au détriment des secteurs 4 productivité supérieure a\n\nla moyenne. Les gains de productivité du travail réalisés avant la révolution ont été perdus au profit de l’augmentation de l’emploi. Entre 2011 et 2017, la composante intra-secteurs a contribué négativement, car les secteurs ont affiché une baisse de productivité, a quelques exceptions prés (administration publique, services de santé et d’enseignement, agriculture, commerce et services financiers). La composante inter- secteurs, qui saisit l’effet de la réaffectation de la main-\n\nd’ceuvre des secteurs a productivité du travail inférieure\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\na la moyenne vers les secteurs 4 productivité du travail supérieure a la moyenne, explique la plus grande partie des modestes gains de productivité du travail (Graphique 1.37 panel b). Toutefois, le changement structurel observé au cours de cette période ne sera pas en mesure de stimuler la croissance économique 4 |’avenir. La main-d’ceuvre a opéré un transfert vers des secteurs dont la productivité est supérieure a la moyenne, mais dont la croissance de la\n\nproductivité est négative. Léconomie tunisienne se retrouve coincée dans un équilibre de faible productivité et fonctionne en dessous de son potentiel. Avant la révolution, la productivité par secteur a augmenté le plus dans les secteurs de l’exploitation miniére, des services publics, de l’administration publique, de agriculture, des transports et communications et de Vindustrie manufacturiére. A exception de l’industrie manufacturiére, les gains de productivité obtenus avant la révolution se sont produits sur des marchés de monopoles ou non contestables dominés par les sociétés publiques, ou la productivité refléte davantage les rentes que les gains Wefficacité. Des entreprises contrélées par l’Etat sont encore présentes dans les secteurs de la banque, des mines et des services publics (OCDE 2018).

Le chapitre 1 documente un glissement progressif de Péconomie tunisienne vers un modéle de développement économique moins durable, fondé sur la demande intérieure et s’inscrivant dans le contexte d’un déclin de la productivité globale qui met en évidence des inefficacités a la fois techniques et touchant a l’affectation des ressources. Il montre que la transformation structurelle s’est poursuivie lentement et que la majorité des travailleurs sont toujours employés dans des secteurs dont la productivité est inférieure a la moyenne. Le chapitre illustre également que les gains de productivité du travail réalisés avant la révolution ont été perdus au profit de la croissance de l’emploi depuis 2011, une croissance qui n’a néanmoins pas suivi l’expansion de la population en Age de travailler. (Uencadré 2.1 contient les\n\ndéfinitions de certains termes)\n\nCe chapitre propose d’abord une vue d’ensemble de Pévolution de la démographie en Tunisie au cours des derniéres décennies, notamment des tendances dans la pyramide des ages et le niveau d’études de la population, et la facon dont la structure démographique est trés susceptible de changer a l’avenir. Cette partie illustre aussi les tendances du marché du travail, tels que les récents changements provoqués par la pandémie de COVID-19. Laccent est mis sur l’accés au marché du travail au niveau global et en fonction des caractéristiques individuelles, ainsi qu’auprés des groupes défavorisés. Ce chapitre aborde aussi la participation des femmes et des jeunes au marché du travail. Il met en évidence la maniére dont certains groupes de femmes s’en sortent mieux que d’autres en termes d’accés au marché du travail et fournit un résumé des contraintes qui pésent sur la participation des femmes au marché du travail, sur la base d’une analyse documentaire des ouvrages spécialisés et de la documentation paralléle. Le chapitre se concentre également sur le chémage et l’inactivité des jeunes, en particulier des diplémés universitaires, et étudie les principaux obstacles a une transition sans heurts entre\n\nle monde de lécole et celui du travail. Démographie et projections\n\nLa Tunisie se trouve aux derniers stades d’une transition démographique. Les changements démographiques ont des effets non négligeables sur |’évolution du marché du travail, la croissance économique et le niveau de vie dans\n\ntous les pays. En Tunisie, le taux de fécondité, qui mesure\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nle nombre de naissances par femme, a diminué de plus de moitié au cours des 40 derniéres années, passant de 5,1 en 1980 a 2,2 en 2018 (IDM), et l’espérance de vie est passée de 62 ans en 1980 a plus de 76 ans aujourd’hui. Ces changements ont eu un impact sur le taux de croissance de la population, qui est passé de 2,6 % en 1980 a environ 1,1 % aucours des cing derniéres années, mais aussi sur la pyramide des Ages. Le ratio de dépendance démographique, qui représente le rapport entre la population en age de travailler et celle en age de ne pas travailler, est passé de 84 (pour 100 personnes en Age de travailler) en 1980 a 44,4 en 2011. Il a progressivement augmenté (48,9 en 2019) et devrait continuer 4 augmenter lentement au cours des deux prochaines décennies (Graphique 2.1). La hausse du ratio de dépendance des personnes Agées, qui l’emportera sur la baisse du ratio de dépendance des enfants, fera\n\nlentement passer le ratio de dépendance démographique total de 49,6 en 2020 a 51,6 en 2040 (Graphique 2.1). Sur le plan démographique, la fenétre de tir est réduite, mais atteignable. La population jeune, qui est le principal contributeur aux nouvelles entrées sur le marché du travail, oscillera autour de 21 % en tant que part de la population totale au cours des deux prochaines décennies et diminuera progressivement par la suite (Graphique 2.2 Graphique 2.3). La population en Age de travailler (15-64 ans) diminuera modestement, passant de 66,8 % 4 66,0 % d’ici 2040. Ce dernier résultat est le sous-produit d’une modeste augmentation de la part des jeunes (15-29 ans), d’une baisse de 5,4 points de pourcentage de la part des individus de 30 4 44 ans et d’une augmentation de 4 points de pourcentage de la part des individus de 45 a 64 ans. En revanche, la part des personnes agées, de 65 ans et plus, va presque doubler, passant de 8,9 4 16,0 %, en grande partie grace a l’augmentation de l’espérance de vie des femmes. La création d’emplois pour une population en Age de travailler encore importante et de plus en plus instruite sera essentielle pour tirer parti du dividende démographique. Augmenter les taux de participation et d’emploi chez les groupes qui accusent actuellement un retard sera un défi majeur que le gouvernement tunisien\n\net les autres parties prenantes devront relever compte tenu\n\ndu vieillissement de la population. Plus de 60 (70) % de la population (urbaine) habite dans les régions cétiéres. La part de la population située dans les régions cétiéres de la Tunisie, a savoir le Grand Tunis, le Nord-Est et le Centre-Est, est passée de 60 a 62 % entre 2006 et 2017 (Tableau 2.1). Ces régions se sont également urbanisées et, en 2017, elles abritaient prés de 72 % de\n\nla population urbaine du pays.

La part de la population urbaine est passée d’environ 65 % en 2006 a 68 % en 2017. Toutes les régions ont enregistré une expansion du taux d’urbanisation, a l’exception du Sud-Ouest, ow la part est restée constante, 4 68 %. Au cours des derniéres décennies, les Tunisiens ont réalisé des progrés substantiels en matiére de résultats scolaires. En 2014, environ 8 Tunisiens sur 10 étaient alphabétisés, contre moins de 1 sur 2 trois décennies plus tot. Le taux dalphabétisation est comparable au taux moyen de la région (79,3 % en 2019) et inférieur a la moyenne des pays a revenu intermédiaire (86,4 % en 2019). Le taux brut de scolarisation dans l’enseignement secondaire est passé de 25,1 % en 1980 a 92,7 % en 2016, et le taux brut de scolarisation dans lenseignement supérieur est passé de 5,0 % en 1980 a 31,8 % en 2019. Ces chiffres sont 4 comparer avec 81,7 (41,0) pour cent et 77,2 (36,9) pour cent pour le taux d’inscription dans le secondaire (supérieur) parmi les pays de la région et groupes de revenus de comparaison, respectivement. Pourtant, 1 Tunisien en age de travailler sur 5 n’a jamais obtenu de certificat scolaire. Les progrés réalisés au cours des derniéres décennies se reflétent dans le niveau de scolarité des différentes cohortes de la population en Age de travailler. Le taux d’alphabétisation est passé d’environ 17 % et 51 % chez les femmes et les hommes nés avant 1950, respectivement, a plus de 95 % chez les jeunes générations (nées dans les années 1990) (Graphique 2.4). De méme, le niveau d’études s’est considérablement amélioré au fil du temps. Environ 1 Tunisien sur 3 né dans les années\n\n1990 est titulaire d’un dipléme universitaire, contre 1 sur 4 parmi les Tunisiens nés entre 1980 et 1989 et moins de 2 % dans la cohorte née avant 1950 (Graphique 2.5). Le nombre de diplémés universitaires supplémentaires a atteint un pic au cours de l’année universitaire 2010/11 et a commencé a diminuer par la suite, pour atteindre environ 52 000 en 2018/19. Parallélement, en 2017, environ 20 % de la population en age de travailler n’a pas fait d’études (23,5 % en 2006) ; environ 30 % a achevé sa scolarité primaire ; 34 % suivi des études secondaires ; et 15,6 % est diplémée de Penseignement supérieur (10 % en 2006) (Graphique 2.6).

La qualité de l’enseignement accuse un retard en Tunisie par rapport aux pays de comparaison. Les enfants nés en Tunisie aujourd’hui seront 52 % aussi productifs a Page adulte qu’ils auraient pu l’étre s’ils avaient bénéficié dune scolarité compléte et d’une bonne santé. indice du capital humain en Tunisie est inférieur 4 la moyenne des pays de la région, mais supérieur 4 la moyenne des pays a revenu moyen/tranche inférieure. Lindice est plus élevé en Tunisie qu’au Maroc, mais plus bas qu’en Albanie (63), en Indonésie (54), en Jordanie (55), en Malaisie (61) et en Roumanie (58). En 2010-20, l’indice de la Tunisie a légérement diminué, passant de 0,53 a 0,52, en grande partie en raison d’une baisse des résultats aux tests harmonisés. Ces scores mesurent les performances dans les programmes de tests internationaux. Les éléves tunisiens obtiennent un score de 384 (405 en 2010) sur une échelle ot 625 représente le niveau supérieur et 300 le niveau\n\nminimum. Selon le Programme international pour le suivi des acquis des éléves (PISA) de 2015, la Tunisie a obtenu des résultats bien inférieurs 4 la moyenne de OCDE en lecture (361 contre 490), dans les matiéres scientifiques (386 contre 491) et en mathématiques (367 contre 487). Une baisse des scores a également été constatée en 2012-15. Vétude TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) fournit des données sur les résultats en mathématiques et dans les matiéres scientifiques des éléves de la 4e a la 8e année tous les quatre ans depuis 1995. En 2011, les résultats moyens en mathématiques des éléves de 4e et de 8e année en Tunisie étaient respectivement de 359 et 425, et les résultats moyens dans les matiéres scientifiques étaient de 346 et 439 (Graphique 2.7 Graphique 2.8).

Accés au marché du travail : coup de projecteur sur les femmes et les jeunes\n\nL’amélioration rapide des résultats scolaires s’est accom- pagnée d’une réduction totale de l’écart et, dans certains cas, d’une inversion des disparités entre les hommes et les femmes. Le taux d’alphabétisation des femmes est passé de 35,8 % a 72,2 % entre 1984 et 2014 et, parmi les cohortes plus jeunes, les femmes sont aujourd’hui a égalité avec les hommes (voir Graphique 2.4). Environ 17 % des femmes en Age de travailler sont titulaires dun dipléme de l’enseignement supérieur, contre 13,9 % pour les hommes. LVécart est considérablement plus important chez les jeunes de 25 4 29 ans (38,2 % contre 23,7 % chez les jeunes femmes et les jeunes hommes, respectivement). Au cours de la derniére décennie, environ 70 % des diplémés universitaires sont des femmes. Vindice de capital humain est plus élevé chez les femmes (54) que chez les hommes (50). En 4e année, les filles obtiennent de meilleurs résultats que les garcons dans les évaluations des matiéres scientifiques (TIMSS 2011), mais, en 8e année, les garcons font légérement mieux que les filles, aussi bien en mathématiques que dans les matiéres scientifiques. Parmi les éléves de 15 ans, les filles obtiennent de meilleurs résultats que les garcons en lecture, tandis que les garcons et les filles obtiennent les\n\nmémes résultats en mathématiques et dans les matiéres scientifiques (PISA 2015) (Graphique 2.10). Tendances en matiére d’accés au marché du travail\n\nEn Tunisie, le capital humain est sous-exploité : plus d’un Tunisien en Age de travailler sur deux est sans emploi et ne cherche pas de travail. La population en age de travailler, agée de 15 ans et plus, comprend 8,7 millions de personnes (76 % de la population totale) qui peuvent contribuer de maniére productive a l’économie (2017) (voir Graphique 2.10). Environ 47 % de la population en age de travailler est active sur le marché du travail, et 53 % n’est ni employée ni a la recherche d’un emploi, ce qui correspond a 4,6 millions de personnes. Parmi les inactifs, plus de 8 sur 10 (soit 3,7 millions de personnes) ne sont pas non plus aux études. Le taux de participation au marché du travail en Tunisie est supérieur a la moyenne de la région MENA (43,2 % en 2017, a l’exception des pays a revenu élevé), mais considérablement faible par rapport a la moyenne des pays a revenu intermédiaire (64,9 % en 2017).

        "Moins de 3 femmes sur 10 participent au marché du travail. A 26,5 %, contre 68,3 % chez les hommes (2017), la participation des femmes au marché du travail a augmenté modestement au cours de la décennie (24,4 % en 2006) (voir Tableau 2.2). La participation des jeunes a également été inférieure a la moyenne, en grande partie grace a l’augmentation des inscriptions dans l’enseignement secondaire et supérieur. Le taux d’activité des personnes n’ayant pas fait d’études était exceptionnellement bas. En 2017, leur taux de participation au marché du travail était estimé 4 18,1 %, contre 24,7 % en 2006. Cette situation était principalement attribuable aux femmes de\n\n30 4 44 ans et de 45 a 64 ans n’ayant pas fait d’études. Environ 15 % de la population active est au chémage, un taux plus élevé qu’il y a dix ans. Environ 0,6 million de personnes a la recherche d’un emploi n’ont pas pu en trouver en 2017 (voir Graphique 2.10). Cela correspond a\n\nun taux de chémage de 15,3 %, presque trois fois plus élevé\n\nque le taux observé dans les pays a revenu intermédiaire et environ 2,5 points de pourcentage de plus que la moyenne des pays de la région. Au cours des années précédant la révolution de 2011, le taux de chémage est passé de 12,5 % en 2006 a 18,3 % en 2011. Depuis lors, il a progressivement diminué, mais il reste supérieur au taux d’il y a dix ans et est nettement plus élevé que la moyenne des pays de la région (10,9 %) et des groupes de revenus (5,6 %) de comparaison\n\n(Tableau 2.3.). Le chémage est plus élevé chez les femmes et les diplémés universitaires. Le taux de chémage moyen de 15,3 % masque une hétérogénéité considérable. Bien que les femmes comme les hommes aient affiché une baisse du chémage a partir de 2011, le taux de chémage est plus élevé chez les femmes que chez les hommes. En 2017, il était estimé a 22,6 % chez les femmes et 4 12,4 % chez les hommes. Des écarts considérables sont observés entre les tranches d’age et les niveaux de scolarité. Le taux de ch6mage des jeunes de 15 a 29 ans était de 33,2 % en 2017, en baisse par rapport au niveau atteint en 2011 (38,2 %)."

Les zones rurales et les régions intérieures sont a la traine dans l’ensemble des chiffres du marché du travail. Les individus en milieu rural s’investissent moins sur le marché du travail que leurs homologues urbains : en 2017, environ 4 Tunisiens sur 10 en milieu rural ont participé au marché du travail par rapport a prés de 5 sur 10 en milieu urbain (voir Tableau 2.3). Vécart du taux d’activité s’est élargi de 2 points de pourcentage en 2006 a prés de 6 points de pourcentage en 2017 en raison 4 la fois d’une augmentation constante dans les zones urbaines et d’une baisse dans les zones rurales depuis 2011. A 15,9 % en 2017, le taux de chémage dans les zones urbaines était supérieur au taux dans les zones rurales (13,9 %), alors que les deux taux ont diminué a partir de 2011 et sont toujours au-dessus du niveau observé en 2006. On observe de grandes disparités d’une région a l’autre (voir Tableau 2.3) Les régions intérieures plus défavorisées ont affiché a la fois des taux de participation au marché du travail plus faibles (42,3 % contre 49,8 % dans les régions intérieures et cOtiéres, respectivement, en 2017) et un chémage plus élevé (20,1 % contre 12,9 % dans les régions intérieures et cOtiéres, respectivement, en 2017). Le taux de chémage était de 25,6 % et 24,3 % dans les régions du Sud-Ouest et du Sud-Est, respectivement, suivi des régions du Centre- Ouest et du Nord-Ouest, avec 17,4 % et 16,7 %. Les régions du Nord-Est et du Centre-Est ont affiché des taux de chémage d’environ 10,0 %, tandis que la région du Grand Tunis a atteint 17,0 %. Le chOmage a modestement baissé a partir de 2011 dans toutes les régions, mais seul le Nord-Est affichait en 2017 un taux de chomage inférieur a celui de la décennie précédente (10,4 % en 2017 contre 14,2 % en 2006) grace a une croissance réguliére du nombre de\n\npersonnes employées. Les chémeurs sont en grande partie des jeunes, des hommes, des personnes n’ayant pas dépassé le niveau d’études primaire ou secondaire, et des résidents en milieu urbain.

Environ 40 % des inactifs sont des jeunes de 15 4 29 ans, dont 31 % ont entre 15 et 24 ans et sont en grande partie scolarisés (voir Graphique 2.11). Environ 20 % de la population inactive est 4gée de 30 a 44 ans, et 42 % est agée de 45 ans ou plus. La grande majorité des personnes inactives sont des femmes (71 %) et sont peu instruites. Prés d’une personne sur trois n’a pas fait d’études, 26 % a achevé sa scolarité primaire et 34 % a suivi un enseignement secondaire. Moins de 9 % des inactifs ont un dipléme universitaire.

Les Tunisiens quittent l’agriculture et sont de plus en plus embauchés dans le secteur des services.'* Sur environ 3,5 millions d’employés en 2017, 85 % travaillaient dans des secteurs non agricoles, principalement dans les services (52 %) (Graphique 2.12). La part des travailleurs dans agriculture a diminué de 23 % (plus de 60 000 individus) au cours de la décennie, passant de 19,2 % en 2006 a 14,8 % en 2017, et le rythme de la transition s’est accéléré a partir de 2011. La part du secteur secondaire est passée de 32,0 % a 33,3 % entre 2006 et 17, mais elle est restée en deca du pic atteint en 2011 (33,7 %). Dans le secteur secondaire, la fabrication de produits alimentaires a affiché une croissance de plus de 44,0 pour cent (soit plus de 28 000 personnes), suivie de la construction, avec une augmentation d’environ 34,0 pour cent, et des autres industries manufacturiéres (26,7 pour cent) (Tableau 2.4).

Vadministration publique, ainsi que le secteur de Penseignement et de la santé, ont contribué a environ 20 % de Pemploi total, avec environ 658 000 employés. Le commerce était le deuxiéme secteur le plus important. Le commerce a également été le principal contributeur a la création d’emplois dans le secteur des services (+111 300), suivi par l’administration publique, les services de santé et d’éducation, l’immobilier et les services spécialisés, et les\n\ntransports. La plupart des Tunisiens travaillent pour un salaire. Environ 75 % de la population active travaille pour un salaire (2017), soit une augmentation de plus de 10 % sur la décennie, avec une croissance réguliére et stable avant et aprés la révolution de 2011 (Graphique 2.13). Ce taux est supérieur a la moyenne des pays a revenu intermédiaire (47,6 %) et de cette région du monde (62,6 %,al’exclusion des pays a revenu élevé). La part des travailleurs familiaux non rémunérés a considérablement diminué, passant de prés de 7,0 % en 2006 a moins de 3,0 % en 2017, tout comme la part des travailleurs 4 leur compte, passant denviron 19,0 % a 15,5 %.

Les effets sur le marché du travail se sont traduits par une détérioration du niveau de vie des ménages tunisiens.'° Les travailleurs du secteur public ont été les moins touchés par la pandémie, principalement en raison d’une réduction des heures de travail ou de retards dans le paiement des salaires (sur la base des données relatives a novembre 2020).

Les employeurs et travailleurs a leur compte ont été confrontés a un certain nombre de difficultés, principalement en raison d’une baisse de la demande (76 %), d’un accés difficile aux clients en raison des restrictions de mobilité (74 %), d’un accés difficile aux fournisseurs (71 %) et dune disponibilité limitée des facteurs de production et des augmentations de prix (75 %).'7 Bien que les agriculteurs ne représentent qu’une faible part de Pemploi total, ils ont été confrontés a de graves difficultés, notamment des réductions d’intrants et une sécheresse qui a entrainé une baisse des revenus, et 77 % d’entre eux ont connu ou s’attendaient a des récoltes moins importantes). Avec les employeurs, les travailleurs 4 leur compte et les travailleurs salariés informels, les agriculteurs ont enregistré une forte baisse du revenu des ménages, et seuls 18 % des personnes interrogées ont déclaré en février 2020 avoir recu une forme d’aide publique. Les principaux mécanismes d’adaptation étaient l’épargne (50 %), le réseau social (national, 45 % ; international, 10 %), l’aide financiére des banques ou d’autres préteurs (11 %), ou la vente d’actifs (15 %). Les effets négatifs sur le marché du travail, combinés aux difficultés d’accés aux services et aux augmentations de prix, ont eu pour conséquence majeure une détérioration du niveau de vie. Environ 1 ménage tunisien sur 2 a signalé une baisse de son revenu en octobre par rapport a la période précédant la pandémie ; les proportions étaient de plus de 6 sur 10 parmi les ménages appartenant aux 40 % inférieurs. Environ 1 ménage sur 5a déclaré qu’il y avait eu une aggravation tout au long de la pandémie, c’est-a-dire entre mai et octobre. Dans le méme temps, la pandémie a accéléré la transformation\n\nnumérique (encadré 2.2). Ecarts entre hommes et femmes\n\nTAUX DE PARTICIPATION AU MARCHE DU TRAVAIL\n\nIl existe des arguments d’équité économique et sociale forts a l’amélioration des conditions du marché du travail chez les femmes. D’un point de vue purement économique, la faible participation des femmes constitue une sous- utilisation des ressources humaines, en particulier a la lumiére des progrés considérables réalisés dans le domaine de l’enseignement, ot les filles dépassent les garcons en termes de résultats scolaires. Une participation moindre des femmes contribue a une baisse des revenus\n\net du niveau de vie et peut se traduire par des taux de\n\n\"Les réponses renvoient aux 60 jours précédant la semaine de ’enquéte. pauvreté plus élevés. Le vieillissement de la population exacerbe le probleme. augmentation de la proportion de personnes Agées et la diminution de la main-d’ceuvre devront étre contrebalancées par une augmentation de la participation des groupes dont le taux d’activité est faible. Laugmentation de la participation au marché du travail des femmes moins instruites, dont beaucoup font partie des pauvres et des 40 % inférieurs, pourrait également rendre la croissance plus inclusive. En outre, l’égalité des sexes et l’autonomisation des femmes sont des droits fondamentaux et des objectifs de développement capitaux, comme le prévoient les objectifs de développement durable des Nations unies. A échelle mondiale, les disparités entre les hommes et les femmes dans les domaines du marché du travail ont remarquablement résisté au changement, malgré les progrés réalisés dans d’autres dimensions de l’égalité des sexes (Klasen 2019a ; Banque mondiale 2011, 2014a). Malgré certains progrés, la participation des femmes au marché du travail est faible en Tunisie par rapport aux normes internationales et par rapport aux hommes. En moyenne, la participation des femmes au marché du travail a été mesurée a environ 25 % au cours de la décennie, ce qui représente environ la moitié du taux moyen des pays de POCDE (51,5 %), environ 20 points de pourcentage de moins que la moyenne des pays a revenu intermédiaire (45,2 % en 2017), et environ 8 points de pourcentage de plus que la moyenne des pays de la région (18 % en 2017) (Graphique 2.17). Au fil du temps, la participation des femmes en Tunisie a augmenté. En 2017, 26,5 % des femmes en age de travailler ont participé au marché du travail, contre 24,4 % en 2006 (Graphique 2.18). Estimé a 41, 8 points de pourcentage en 2017, l’écart hommes- femmes quant au taux de participation au marché du travail est frappant, méme s’il s’est réduit d’environ 1 point de pourcentage par rapport a 2006, en raison d’une augmentation moins prononcée du taux de participation au marché du travail des hommes par rapport a celui des femmes (+1,5 % contre +8,6 %, respectivement, entre 2006 et 2017). La participation des femmes au marché du travail est particuliérement faible dans le centre et le sud ainsi que dans les zones rurales. La participation moyenne des femmes au marché du travail cache des disparités non négligeables entre les gouvernorats et les régions et entre les zones urbaines et rurales. Les gouvernorats du centre et du sud affichent des taux de participation des femmes nettement inférieurs. Par exemple, 4 Kasserine, le taux est estimé a 15,7 % contre 35,4 % a Tunis (Carte 2.1). Des\n\ndifférences substantielles sont observées d’une région a\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nENCADRE 2.2. Plateformes numériques de travail\n\nL’'épidémie de COVID-19 et les mesures de confinement mises en place dans de nombreux pays pour contenir la propagation du virus ont accéléré une transformation numérique en cours depuis des décennies. Des millions de citoyens du monde entier sont passés a un mode de vie « en ligne ». Les enfants disposant d’un accés a internet 4 domicile ont pu suivre des cours en virtuel. De nombreux employés, notamment ceux exercant des professions a rémunération forte ou moyenne, ont commencé a travailler depuis leur domicile. De nombreuses entreprises ont adopté des modéles commerciaux numériques pour poursuivre leurs activités et minimiser les pertes de revenus. Dans le méme temps, la numérisation a contribué a contenir la pandémie, par exemple grace a I’utilisation d’applications mobiles développées pour suivre et repérer les personnes infectées et leurs cas contacts. Cependant, la pandémie a également exacerbé le fossé de |’accés aux technologies numériques d'un pays a l'autre et, au sein d’un méme pays, entre les ménages plus ou moins aisés. Le taux de pénétration de la téléphonie est plus important en Tunisie que dans la plupart des pays en développement du Maghreb, a I’exception de I’Algérie. A environ 86 %, la couverture 4G est la deuxiéme plus vaste en Tunisie aprés celle du Maroc (CUA et OCDE 2021). La part des entreprises disposant d’un site web est estimée a 66 % en moyenne, avec un pic a 81 % parmi les grandes entreprises. Avec le Maroc, a 69 %, ce sont les taux les plus élevés du Maghreb (CUA et OCDE 2021). Cette part diminue avec la taille de l’entreprise. Ainsi, elle se situe entre 81 % pour les grandes entreprises et 59 % pour les petites entreprises (CUA et OCDE 2021). Cela exclut les petites unités de production informelles, dont la part disposant d’un site web est estimée a moins de 2 %. Environ 9,4 % d’entre elles déclarent utiliser internet, et une proportion similaire déclare utiliser un ordinateur (10,5 %).? Outre une bonne couverture internet et un fort taux de pénétration de la téléphonie mobile, la mise a disposition de méthodes de paiement électronique, de plateforme de financement bien développées et d’infrastructures de transport adéquates est essentielle pour favoriser le développement de plateformes numériques d’échange de biens, de services et de travail. Cela pourrait contribuer a soutenir un modéle de croissance axé sur les services, dans lequel les services innovants a |’échelle de la planéte, tels que les technologies de information et de la communication (TIC), la finance et les services spécialisés, pourraient coexister avec les travaux domestiques et les services marchands peu qualifiés pour créer davantage de perspectives d’embauche a productivité élevée pour tous. Les services d’innovation mondiaux exigent une forte intensité de main-d’ceuvre qualifiée, mais ils générent des effets d’entrainement positifs dans d’autres secteurs, notamment |industrie manufacturiére, grace a leurs liens et a la demande accrue induite par des revenus plus élevés (Nayyar, Hallward-Driemeier et Davies 2021). Les services peu qualifiés peuvent trouver davantage de débouchés sur des marchés plus vastes en raison des plates-formes numériques et de I’incitation a se développer sur la base du capital immatériel (Nayyar, Hallward-Driemeier et Davies, 2021). Les plateformes numériques de travail proposent un nouveau moyen de stimuler la demande et l'offre et de développer la demande de main-d’ceuvre en augmentant la taille du marché. Sur les plateformes numériques, les taches peuvent étre effectuées a distance, par exemple, dans les services juridiques et financiers, le développement de logiciels, les services de traduction, la programmation et I’analyse de données, et il n'y a aucune limite géographique a la taille du marché. Dans le cas des plateformes de travail localisé, le travail est effectué en personne dans des lieux physiques désignés par les travailleurs ; il peut s’agir, par exemple, de services de taxi, de services de livraison et de services 4 domicile, de services ménagers et de services de soins a la personne. Le premier type de plateformes est susceptible d’accroitre les perspectives d’embauche parmi les travailleurs instruits, tandis que les plateformes de travail localisé peuvent constituer un moyen supplémentaire et plus efficace de faire correspondre |’offre et la demande de main-d’ceuvre peu qualifiée. Les deux plateformes ont le potentiel de favoriser la participation au marché du travail et l'emploi des femmes. Selon les enquétes menées par |’Organisation internationale du travail (OIT), la majorité des travailleurs présente sur les plateformes numériques de travail sont des jeunes (de moins de 35 ans) instruits (OIT 2021). Les femmes sont également présentes sur ces plateformes, bien qu’elles n’y contribuent qu’a hauteur de 4 travailleurs sur 10 sur les plateformes numériques et a seulement 1 travailleur sur 10 sur les plateformes de travail localisé en raison de la composition par secteur des emplois sur ces plateformes (OIT 2021). Les données montrent également qu'une plus grande flexibilité, une meilleure rémunération et l’absence d’autres perspectives d’emploi sont les principaux facteurs qui poussent les travailleurs a utiliser ces plateformes numériques de travail localisé. Pratiquement tous les travailleurs trouvent leurs principales sources de revenus du travail sur ces plateformes, et ces revenus peuvent étre plus élevés que dans les secteurs traditionnels, comme dans le cas des services de taxi et de livraison gérés par des applications mobiles. Les plateformes numériques ne sont toutefois pas une panacée et les perspectives qu’elles proposent s’accompagnent souvent de défis non négligeables. La régularité du travail et des revenus, les conditions de travail, l'accés 4 la protection sociale, le droit 4 la négociation collective, la discrimination et le harcélement sont des exemples de problémes couramment signalés par les travailleurs actifs sur les plateformes numériques de travail (OIT 2021). En outre, la concurrence déloyale est souvent citée comme le probléme le plus important soulevé par les entreprises traditionnelles, car certaines plateformes ne sont pas soumises au cadre fiscal et reéglementaire classique. (suite)\n\nAccés au marché du travail : coup de projecteur sur les femmes et les jeunes\n\nENCADRE 2.2. Plateformes numériques de travail (suite)\n\nPour tirer pleinement parti des plateformes numériques, le cadre réglementaire doit minimiser les obstacles a |’entrée sur le marché afin de contréler le pouvoir de marché des opérateurs numériques historiques et de permettre aux nouveaux entrants de conserver leurs incitations a la concurrence (Banque mondiale 2019). En outre, dans le cas des plateformes de travail localisé qui peuvent contribuer a apporter des travailleurs issus des secteurs traditionnels, comme la main-d’ceuvre peu qualifiée dans les domaines de la construction ou des services alimentaires, le degré de concurrence dans les secteurs dans lesquels les employeurs cherchent a embaucher de la main-d’ceuvre par le biais de plateformes numériques est crucial. Fournir de la main-d’ceuvre par le biais de plateformes numériques risque de ne pas générer des emplois en plus grand nombre ou de meilleure qualité s’il n'y a qu'une ou une poignée d’entreprises exploitant le secteur, car elles peuvent décider ses prix des produits, des services et de la main-d’ceuvre qu’elles utilisent. Certains gouvernements ont introduit avec succés des mesures réglementaires qui peuvent contribuer a améliorer les conditions de travail sur les plateformes numériques. Plusieurs d’entre eux ont étendu la sécurité sociale aux travailleurs des plateformes, y compris la couverture des frais d’assurance accident payés par les plateformes, I’extension de la sécurité sociale et la fourniture d‘indemnités pour accident du travail et décés et d‘indemnités de maladie et de chémage (OIT 2021). En Tunisie, le contrat social qui, pendant des décennies, a reposé sur un vaste secteur public et les sociétés publiques pour tenir la promesse de création d’emplois a échoué. Les taux de chémage élevés chez les diplémés universitaires et le grand nombre de travailleurs employés de maniére informelle avec de faibles revenus et peu de protection constituent un appel urgent a l’action. La création d’emplois ne peut pas relever de la responsabilité du secteur public et de quelques opérateurs historiques bien connectés. Une nouvelle voie pourrait tirer parti du commerce électronique, des technologies financiéres, des plates-formes numériques de travail et, plus généralement, de |’économie numérique pour établir un nouvel équilibre, qui permettrait d’atteindre de nouveaux marchés et de créer davantage d’emplois assortis de meilleures conditions de travail. Pourtant, la concurrence sur et hors des plateformes numériques dans les secteurs protégés et le cadre réglementaire des plateformes numériques sont essentiels pour réduire le risque de générer de nouvelles cohortes de travailleurs non protégés a faibles revenus. a.

Pautre ainsi qu’entre les zones urbaines et rurales dans leur ensemble et entre les zones urbaines et rurales au sein de chaque région (Graphique 2.19). A l’échelle régionale, les écarts de participation entre les hommes et les femmes vont de 35,3 % dans le Grand Tunis 4 49,4 % dans le Sud-Est. Cependant, les plus grandes différences géographiques sont détectées entre les zones urbaines et rurales. Le taux de participation moyen des femmes dans les zones rurales est de 18,3 %, contre 30,3 % dans les zones urbaines. La disparité entre les hommes et les femmes est beaucoup plus importante dans les zones rurales, avec plus de 51 points de pourcentage, que dans les zones urbaines, ot il est estimé a 37,5 %. (Cela s’explique également par des taux légérement inférieurs chez les hommes dans les zones urbaines par rapport aux zones rurales) Dans les zones rurales des régions du sud et du nord-ouest, la disparité entre les hommes et les femmes est estimée 4 54-55 points\n\nde pourcentage (Graphique 2.19). Les différences dans les caractéristiques observables des femmes sont un facteur clé pour expliquer les différences géographiques dans la participation des femmes au marché du travail, mais d’autres facteurs jouent un réle dans certains gouvernorats. Un simple exercice visant a comprendre si la plupart des différences dans les taux de participation des femmes entre les gouvernorats sont dues aux caractéristiques des femmes plutét qu’a d’autres facteurs, tels que les infrastructures, les institutions, la discrimination ou les normes sociales, indique qu’une grande partie des écarts peut étre attribuée aux différences démographiques, notamment l’ge, la situation matrimoniale,\n\nla présence et le nombre d’enfants, et le niveau d’études\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\n(Graphique 2.18).'* Les probabilités prédites sans compo- sition et dans |’échantillon s’alignent parfaitement autour de la ligne de 45 degrés. En particulier, les gouvernorats ot le taux de participation des femmes au marché du travail femmes est le plus faible comptent un plus grand nombre de jeunes femmes, de femmes mariées et de ménages avec des enfants de moins de 15 ans. En outre, des différences considérables dans la part des femmes diplémées de lenseignement supérieur sont observées entre le nord et le sud du pays. Cependant, quelques gouvernorats, a savoir Beja, Bouzide, Jendouba, Kairouan, Kasserine, Sidi Mahdia et Siliana, présentent des taux de participation féminine faibles qui ne peuvent étre expliqués par les caractéristiques observables des femmes. Ces gouvernorats se situent au nord et au centre du pays, et leurs caractéristiques propres, en plus des caractéristiques non observables pour les femmes, semblent jouer un r6le déterminant dans ce cas. La disparité entre les hommes et les femmes en matiére de participation des femmes au marché du travail se creuse avec l’Age et atteint son maximum chez les personnes agées de 30 a 44 ans. Le taux de participation au marché du travail, tant chez les hommes que chez les femmes, est faible dans la tranche d’age la plus jeune, celle des 15-24 ans, en raison de la fréquentation scolaire. Dans la tranche d’age des 15-24 ans, environ 4 garcons sur 10 ont pris part au marché du travail en 2017, contre 2 filles sur 10 (Graphique 2.18). Cet écart est imputable a un taux de scolarisation plus élevé chez les filles, mais aussi a une part plus importante de filles qui ne suivent pas d’enseignement et ne font pas partie de la population active. L’écart se creuse dans les deux tranches d’Age suivantes, 25-29 et 30-44, ot il a atteint 35 et 53 points de pourcentage en 2017, car plus de femmes ne parviennent pas a intégrer le marché du travail ou en sortent en vieillissant. Toutefois, Pécart s’est réduit au cours de la décennie grace a des augmentations sensibles des taux de participation des femmes dans les tranches d’Age correspondantes (environ 6 et 7 points de pourcentage), tandis que la participation des hommes du méme Age a diminué de prés d’un point de pourcentage. La disparité entre les hommes et les femmes en matiére de participation est encore plus importante parmi la population agée de 45 a 64 ans (59 points de\n\npourcentage en 2017) et est resté constante au fil du temps\n\n'SDexercice consiste 4 estimer des équations distinctes pour chaque gouvernorat de la probabilité de participation des femmes au marché du travail en fonction des caractéristiques individuelles, des ménages et de la situation géographique. Dans une deuxiéme étape, les probabilités de participation sont prédites pour chaque gouvernorat sur la base des coefficients d’estimation spécifiques 4 chaque gouvernorat dans l’échantillon (les caractéristiques des femmes vivant dans chaque gouvernorat) et des caractéristiques des femmes hors échantillon, c’est-a-dire dans l’ensemble du pays.

        "Les cohortes de femmes les plus jeunes affichent des taux de participation plus élevés que les cohortes de femmes plus agées. Les chiffres moyens cachent d’importantes variations entre les cohortes et tout au long du cycle de vie (Graphique 2.22). Chez les femmes, les effets de cohorte et de cycle de vie sont importants, alors que les effets de cohorte ne jouent pas un grand réle chez les hommes. Les hommes ont tendance a atteindre des taux de participation élevés, supérieurs a 90 %, et les cohortes d’hommes plus jeunes (plus 4gés) augmentent (diminuent) leur participation 4 mesure qu’ils entrent (sortent) du marché du travail, tandis que les taux de participation des cohortes intermédiaires restent constants 4 des niveaux élevés (Graphique 2.22 panel a). En revanche, un examen de la participation des femmes au marché du travail a différents Ages indique qu’a tout age, les femmes nées plus récemment participent au marché du travail en plus\n\ngrand nombre que les femmes des cohortes précédentes. Par exemple, environ 45 % des femmes nées dans les années 1990 participaient au marché du travail a l’age de 25 ans, alors que moins de 40 % des femmes nées une décennie plus t6t en faisaient partie a l’Age de 25 ans (Graphique 2.22 panel a). De méme, a l’4ge de 35 ans, 41 % des femmes nées dans les années 1980 sont actives sur le marché du travail, alors que la part correspondante a 35 ans chez les femmes nées dans les années 1970 est de 35 %. Environ 31 % des femmes nées dans les années 1970 étaient actives sur le marché du travail a l’dge de 45 ans, contre environ 26 % des femmes nées dans les années 1960. Il ne s’agit pas d’un effet d’Age étant donné que les différentes cohortes sont comparées au méme Age. Cela semble indiquer qu’un ensemble de facteurs positivement corrélés a la participation des femmes s’est amélioré au fil du temps. Le niveau d’études, les normes et les attitudes, et les conditions d’emploi sont des facteurs potentiels. Un niveau d’études plus élevé chez les femmes concourt a une plus grande participation au marché du travail. 55\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nGRAPHIQUE 2.22.

Dans le méme temps, la part des femmes n’ayant pas fait d’études a diminué, passant de 32 % a 27 %. Un haut niveau d’études entraine un plus fort degré d’attachement au marché du travail tout au long du cycle de vie. En plus de participer au marché du travail en moyenne presque autant que les hommes, les femmes diplomées de l’enseignement supérieur conservent un attachement envers le marché du travail tout au long du cycle de vie, ce qui est similaire a ce qui est observé chez les hommes (voir Graphique 2.23, panel b). Le lien entre enseignement supérieur et participation au marché du travail reste fort 4 des tranches d’Age différentes. Les femmes titulaires d’un dipléme universitaire intégrent le marché du travail plus tard que leurs homologues moins instruites, mais leur taux de participation au marché du travail augmente rapidement pour dépasser 80 % 4 30 ans. Il augmente a nouveau entre 30 et 44 ans et oscille autour de 86 % en moyenne (le taux chez les hommes diplémés universitaires est de 97 % entre 30 et 44 ans). Le lien n’est toutefois pas aussi fort au niveau d’instruction inférieurs, ot les femmes sont dépassées par les hommes d’au moins 30 points de pourcentage, ce qui suggére qu’un niveau d'études élevé est l'un des facteurs clés susceptibles de contribuer a combler l’écart de participation entre les hommes\n\net les femmes. Le mariage, la naissance d’un enfant et les responsabilités liées a l'éducation des enfants sont des facteurs clés\n\nsusceptibles d’expliquer les caractéristiques de la parti- cipation des femmes au marché du travail. La situation matrimoniale des femmes peut expliquer les grandes différences dans les taux de participation des femmes au marché du travail. Lage moyen au premier mariage est de 22,5 ans (d’aprés le recensement de la population de 2014), et environ 80 % des femmes sont mariées avant Page de 36 ans.'’ Les taux de participation des femmes célibataires et mariées ont augmenté pratiquement au méme rythme au cours de la décennie. La part des femmes mariées qui participent au marché du travail reste donc inférieure d’environ 6 points de pourcentage a celle des femmes célibataires (estimée 4 27,2 % et 33,5 %, respectivement, en 2017) (Graphique 2.24, panel a). Lécart entre les femmes mariées et les femmes célibataires se creuse au cours du cycle de vie, avec une augmentation plus rapide de la participation des femmes célibataires (Graphique 2.24 panel b). Cet écart se creuse au début du cycle de vie, atteignant un pic d’environ 31 points de pourcentage 4 la fin de la vingtaine et fluctuant entre 1 et 12 points aprés 40 ans. Cette tendance pourrait indiquer que le mariage, la grossesse et la garde des enfants dissuadent les femmes de (ré)intégrer le marché du travail en raison des normes sociales qui assignent typiquement aux femmes le réle principal de pourvoyeuse de soins. Cela semble étre corroboré par la principale raison pour laquelle la plupart des femmes ne s’investissent pas sur le marché du travail.

Cela s’explique en grande partie par le fait que les jeunes femmes des ménages plus riches peuvent se permettre de rester plus longtemps a |’école. La différence dans la proportion de femmes déclarant effectuer des taches ménagéres se réduit considérablement\n\na mesure que les femmes vieillissent. Une analyse de régression a variables multiples confirme la corrélation entre les caractéristiques observables et la participation des femmes au marché du travail.

Accés au marché du travail : coup de projecteur sur les femmes et les jeunes\n\nENCADRE 2.3. Participation des femmes au marché du travail le long de la distribution des revenus des ménages\n\nPrés de 70 % de la population tunisienne agée de 25 a 54 ans est mariée. La part des couples mariés a leégérement diminué, passant de 78 % en 2006 a 77 % en 2017, et la part des ménages a deux revenus parmi les couples mariés a oscillé autour de 19 % au cours de la décennie. Par conséquent, pour de nombreux travailleurs, les décisions concernant le choix d’intégrer le marché du travail et la vie active sont prises entre les conjoints d'un ménage. Le statut économique du ménage joue un réle majeur (et est endogéne) dans la décision des membres du ménage quant 4 leur participation au marché du travail. Par exemple, dans les ménages pauvres, |’emploi d’‘un membre supplémentaire peut augmenter considérablement le revenu du ménage et le faire passer au-dessus du seuil de pauvreté. En revanche, les femmes dans des ménages aisés peuvent se permettre de ne pas intégrer la vie active en raison de la prévalence d'un effet de revenu. En Tunisie, l’enquéte sur le budget des ménages de 2015 permet d’étudier les tendances de la participation des femmes au marché du travail le long de la distribution des dépenses de consommation des ménages (Graphique B 2.3-1).? Premiérement, la participation au marché du travail des femmes célibataires diminue de fagon monotone le long de la distribution de la consommation. Ainsi, une plus grande part des femmes célibataires des ménages les plus pauvres participent au marché du travail (62,7 %) par rapport aux femmes des ménages plus riches (52,5 % dans le quintile supérieur). Ces chiffres incluent l'ensemble des femmes de 15 ans et plus qui sont célibataires, a l’exclusion des veuves et des femmes divorcées. Ce groupe se compose essentiellement de jeunes femmes qui vivent encore chez leurs parents : 86 % sont des femmes célibataires agées de 15 a 34 ans, et plus de 45 % sont encore aux études. La tendance a la baisse le long de la distribution des revenus refléte probablement un effet de revenu, les jeunes femmes célibataires des ménages plus aisés pouvant se permettre de poursuivre des aspirations académiques. Ce schéma est également conforme aux entretiens qualitatifs, qui montrent que l'intégration des jeunes femmes sur le marché du travail, en particulier dans un travail considéré comme inférieur a leurs qualifications, est souvent motivée par les besoins économiques de leur ménage (Banque mondiale 2014a).

Leur taux de participation au marché du travail augmente le long de la distribution de la consommation, passant de 37,3 % dans le premier quintile a 47,5 % dans le quintile le plus riche. S’il est difficile d’élucider les raisons d'une telle tendance, certaines hypothéses peuvent étre avancées. Les femmes mariées dans les ménages les plus riches sont généralement plus instruites que les femmes vivant dans les ménages les plus pauvres et, en raison de l’appariement assortatif, elles ont également tendance a étre mariées a des maris instruits.* Cela pourrait conduire a la prédominance de |’effet de substitution sur l’effet de revenu, le prix des loisirs étant plus élevé chez les femmes instruites.

Parmi les travailleurs salariés, la part des femmes mariées occupant un emploi dans le secteur public varie entre 14 % dans le quintile inférieur et 63 % dans le quintile supérieur (Tableau B 2.3-2).

On estime que, comparé a une absence de scolarité, le fait d’avoir suivi des études supérieures était associé 4 une probabilité accrue de 40 % d’intégrer le marché du travail en 2017, ce qui est supérieur a l’effet estimé 10 ans plus tét. Leffet de l’enseignement secondaire est lui aussi considérable (16 % en 2017), et il a augmenté au fil du temps. La composition du ménage est importante. La présence de jeunes enfants (de moins de 2 ans) réduit la probabilité de participation d’environ 3 %. De méme, la présence d’enfants de 2 a 5 ans réduit la participation d’environ 2 %. La présence d’enfants de 6 a 15 ans a un effet négatif similaire. En revanche, la présence de personnes agées (65 ans et plus) dans le ménage ne semble pas étre un obstacle majeur a la participation des femmes sur le marché du travail la plupart des années, mais son effet est significatif et estimé a -1,3 % en 2017. Les femmes des zones rurales ainsi que les femmes de toutes les régions, a exception du Nord-Est, sont moins susceptibles de participer au marché du travail que les femmes des zones urbaines et du Grand Tunis. Les caractéristiques observables laissent inexpliquée une grande partie de la disparité entre les hommes et les femmes\n\nen matiére de participation au marché du travail. Cela s’explique par le fait que les caractéristiques individuelles et du ménage considérées dans l’analyse ne sont pas en mesure d’expliquer la plupart des variations observées dans la participation des femmes au marché du travail. Ceci est corroboré par une décomposition Blinder-Oaxaca de l’écart de participation entre les hommes et les femmes (Graphique 2.28 panel a).?! La quasi-totalité de la différence entre les taux de participation — environ 36 points de pourcentage en 2017 — est due a la composante inexpliquée ; moins de 2 points de pourcentage sont imputables aux caractéristiques observables. La partie inexpliquée capte les différences dans les paramétres estimés de |’équation de participation au marché du travail des hommes et des femmes ainsi que les différences dans les variables non observables. Une grande partie des différences entre les coefficients est imputable aux facteurs démographiques et a la situation matrimoniale (annexe Graphique A 2.1), facteurs qui sont fortement corrélés a leur participation.

De plus, le choix des filiéres d’études par les femmes peut expliquer en partie la difficulté a trouver un emploi et peut, 4 moyen terme, les décourager a intégrer le marché du travail. Néanmoins, l’ampleur de la composante inexpliquée pourrait également indiquer des facteurs autres que les caractéristiques socio-économiques et démographiques. Les valeurs culturelles et les normes sociales attribuent aux femmes un réle traditionnel en tant que principales responsables des soins portés aux enfants et aux personnes agées, des taches ménagéres et d’autres activités non marchandes, et pourraient l’emporter sur leffet d’autonomisation de l’enseignement chez les femmes n’ayant pas suivi d’études supérieures. Un simple exercice d’économétrie montre que, méme si les femmes présentaient exactement les mémes caractéristiques que celles observées chez les hommes, notamment l’age, le de scolarité, la situation matrimoniale, etc., le taux de participation prédit par Panalyse de régression a variables multiples augmenterait un peu, mais resterait bien inférieur 4 celui des hommes (Graphique 2.28 panel b).”\n\n~ Une régression selon le modéle probit est estimée en régressant la variable\n\nmuette de participation sur la méme série de caractéristiques décrits Les coefficients estimés sont ensuite utilisés pour générer une prédiction de la probabilité que les femmes participent au marché du travail comme si elles avaient les caractéristiques des hommes. Ainsi, les taux contrefactuels de participation des femmes sont prédits en appliquant les coefficients estimés pour les femmes 4 la distribution des caractéristiques des hommes. EMPLOI ET CHOMAGE\n\nMalgré un écart encore important entre les hommes et les femmes, l’accés des femmes a l’emploi s’est amélioré depuis 2011. En 2006-17, le taux de création d’emplois n’a pas été suffisant pour suivre augmentation de la population en Age de travailler, en particulier chez les femmes. II convient toutefois d’établir une distinction majeure entre les périodes antérieure et postérieure 4 2011 (Graphique 2.29). Entre 2006 et 2011, le taux de création d’emplois a été presque deux fois inférieur au taux de croissance de la population en age de travailler, et le nombre total de femmes actives a diminué de 787 000 a 745 700. Entre 2011 et 2017, l'emploi des femmes a augmenté de plus de 20 %, soit environ trois fois le taux d’augmentation de la population féminine en age de travailler. Chez les hommes, la croissance de l’emploi a été légérement supérieure au taux d’accroissement de la population en age de travailler. Par conséquent, a partir de 2011, le ratio emploi/population a augmenté de maniére modeste chez les hommes et d’environ 2,5 points de pourcentage chez les femmes (de 18,1 % en 20114 20,5 % en 2017), et la disparité entre les hommes et les femmes s’est réduite de prés de 2 points de pourcentage, tout en\n\nrestant légérement supérieure au niveau observé en 2006. Les femmes continuent a accuser un retard par rapport aux hommes en matiére d’accés 4 l’emploi, et les taux de chémage sont considérablement plus élevés chez les femmes que chez les hommes. En 2006, le taux de chOmage\n\ndes femmes était estimé 4 15,1 %, contre 11,5 % pour\n\nAccés au marché du travail : coup de projecteur sur les femmes et les jeunes\n\nGRAPHIQUE 2.29.

Ce dernier s’est développé au fil du temps et a atteint un pic de plus de 12 points de pourcentage en 2011, puis a progressivement diminué pour atteindre environ 10 points en 2017. Cette tendance est en grande partie imputable a une augmentation drastique du chémage chez les femmes entre 2006 et 2011, lorsque le nombre de chémeuses a augmenté de 100 % pour atteindre plus de 280 000 chémeuses en 2011, avant d’entamer un lent déclin par la suite. Le nombre @hommes au chémage a augmenté de 46 % au cours de la premiére période, et il a diminué plus rapidement que chez les femmes par la suite (-15 % entre 2011 et 2017), contribuant ainsi a la réduction de la disparité entre les hommes et les femmes dans les taux de chémage par rapport au niveau atteint en 2011. Le manque de perspectives d’emploi associé une mobilité géographique limitée se traduisent par de grandes disparités entre les taux de chOmage des femmes vivant a l’intérieur des terres et dans les zones c6tiéres. On observe de grandes disparités dans les chiffres du marché du travail, aussi bien chez les hommes que chez les femmes, d’une région et d’un gouvernorat a l’autre. Cette situation s’explique par les différentes perspectives d’emploi et le développement éco- nomique limité des régions intérieures. Toutefois, les écarts géographiques de chémage chez les femmes atteignent des pics de 50 points de pourcentage (21 points de pourcentage dans le cas des hommes en 2017) dans l’ensemble des gouvernorats (Carte 2.2). Dans le gouvernorat de Monastir, situé le long de la céte (région Centre-Est), le taux de chOmage est estimé a 8,4 %, contre 58,6 % dans le gouvernorat de\n\nGRAPHIQUE 2.30.

Dans le cas des femmes, Pamélioration rapide des résultats scolaires se traduit par des problémes plus graves en termes d’insertion sur le marché du travail, notamment dans les zones rurales et les régions intérieures qui offrent moins de perspectives d’emploi. Les jeunes femmes ont plus de difficultés a se déplacer vers des zones ot les perspectives économiques sont florissantes et finissent par étre plus contraintes que les hommes par le manque d’opportunités sur les marchés du travail locaux (encadré 2.4). Les jeunes femmes accusent un retard par rapport aux femmes plus agées et aux hommes en matiére d’accés a lemploi. Les ratios emploi/population sont les plus faibles en Tunisie chez les adolescentes (Graphique 2.31).

La disparité entre les hommes et les femmes de 25 a 29 ans et de 30 a 44 ans a diminué de maniére significative, alors qu’elle est restée pratiquement inchangée en ce qui concerne les tranches les plus jeunes et les plus agées. Entre 2011 et 2017, l’emploi des jeunes femmes a commencé a augmenter rapidement, plus rapidement que la croissance de la population totale dans la tranche d’4ge correspondante. Cette évolution s’est produite parallélement a un déclin continu de l’emploi chez les jeunes hommes.

Migration interne et deux villes secondaires en Tunisie\n\nSelon IINS, entre 2009 et 2014, prés de 690 000 individus se sont déplacés 4 travers les « délégations ». C’est la définition de la migration interne. Plus de 62 % des migrants internes se sont déplacés d’un gouvernorat a l'autre, effectuant des déplacements sur de longues distances. Les gouvernorats des régions cétiéres restent les principaux destinataires des flux de population grace a une concentration d’investissements publics et privés, de services et d’activités économiques (Carte B 2.4-). Entre 2009 et 2014, le solde migratoire était positif dans le Grand Tunis, le Nord-Est et le Centre-Est et négatif dans les autres régions (Banque mondiale 2021b). La migration urbaine a urbaine est dominante. Plus de 80 % de la migration inter-gouvernorats se produit dans les zones urbaines. Le départ des zones rurales vers les villes contribue pour moins de 7 % a \\'ensemble des migrations inter-gouvernorats (Banque mondiale 2021b). CARTE B 2.4.1. Flux nets interdélégation (> 200), 1994 et 2004\n\nSource: Banque mondiale (2021b)\n\nUne étude récente menée par la Banque mondiale (2021b) sur les migrations internes 4 Jendouba et Kairouan, deux villes secondaires situées dans les deux régions intérieures les plus pauvres de la Tunisie, fait apparaitre des résultats intéressants. Les deux villes ont une structure industrielle faible, avec une predominance de I’agriculture, et ont donc des difficultés 4 créer des opportunités économiques. Les deux villes sont en téte des flux d’émigration en faveur des villes cotiéres. Les flux ne sont pas unidirectionnels, car les villes regoivent également d’importants afflux de migrants en provenance des zones rurales et de délégations éloignées au sein des mémes gouvernorats. En 2009-14, la ville de Jendouba a attiré plus de 4 000 migrants, dont plus d’un sur deux provenait de zones urbaines, tandis que la ville de Kairouan a accueilli environ 10 000 migrants, dont plus de sept sur dix provenaient d’autres zones urbaines. Sur la base de discussions de groupe, la Banque mondiale (2021b) constate que de nombreux migrants ont déménagé a Jendouba ou a Kairouan avant de pouvoir trouver un emploi, et que de meilleures perspectives d’embauche, ainsi qu'un meilleur accés aux services et a la sécurité, sont les principaux moteurs de la migration. Les migrants rencontrent cependant des difficultés pour trouver un emploi et s‘'appuient souvent sur des canaux informels pour trouver du travail. A Jendouba, les hommes trouvent généralement des emplois comme ouvriers dans la construction, tandis que les femmes sont plus susceptibles de travailler dans des zones agricoles irriguées hors des villes. A Kairouan, les hommes migrants trouvent des emplois de serveurs, et les femmes migrantes travaillent comme nounous, artisanes, ou dans des usines de confection ou de transformation agroalimentaire si elles ont des compétences spécialisées, compte tenu de la présence d’un secteur industriel dans la ville. La plupart des migrants sont confrontés a des conditions de travail précaires, sans protection du droit du travail ni couverture sociale. En outre, les femmes migrantes doivent supporter la double charge du travail et des soins 4 la famille sans pouvoir compter sur leur réseau social ou leur famille étendue. 66\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nGRAPHIQUE 2.31.

En outre, les disparités entre les hommes et les femmes dans les tranches d’age de 25 a 29 ans et de 30-44 ans se sont considérablement accru. Pratiquement aucune différence n’a été détectée dans les taux de chémage au sein de la tranche la plus agée, celle des 45-64 ans ; les taux sont restés 4 peu prés constants au cours de la décennie. En 2006-2011, le nombre de chémeurs a augmenté rapidement dans toutes les tranches d’age et chez les hommes comme chez les femmes. A partir de 2011, le nombre de jeunes femmes au chémage a commencé a diminuer, passant de plus de 89 000 a 65 500 (15-24 ans) et de 111 500 a 99 600 (25-29 ans). En revanche, ce nombre a continué a augmenter dans les tranches des plus agés. Une tendance similaire est observée chez les jeunes chémeurs et les hommes d’4ge miir. Outre le fait qu’elles sont plus susceptibles de participer au marché du travail, les femmes diplomées de l’enseignement supérieur ont également plus de chances de trouver un emploi. On observe de grandes disparités dans les ratios emploi/population entre les femmes (et les hommes) a différents niveaux de scolarité (Graphique 2.33). Par exemple,\n\nen 2017, le taux d’emploi des femmes n’ayant pas fait d'études était estimé a 8,4 %, contre 19 % pour les femmes ayant achevé leur scolarité primaire et 37,7 % pour les femmes ayant obtenu un dipléme universitaire. Les taux d’emploi ont diminué a tous les niveaux de scolarité, a l'exception de l’enseignement secondaire, qui a rebondi a partir de 2011. LVécart le plus important entre les hommes et les femmes est observé chez les travailleurs ayant achevé leur scolarité primaire et secondaire, ot les taux d’emploi des femmes s’élevaient respectivement a 19 % et 23 %, contre 70 % et 59 % chez les hommes. La forte augmentation de l’offre de nouvelles cohortes de femmes titulaires d’un dipléme universitaire a dépassé la capacité d’absorption de économie. Le taux de chémage des femmes diplémées de l’enseignement supérieur est monté en fléche, passant de 25,5 % 4 41,8 % entre 2006 et 2011, pour osciller autour de 40 % par la suite (Graphique 2.34). La disparité entre les hommes et les femmes est restée constante, a environ 20 points de pourcentage. La majorité des femmes actives occupent un emploi salarié.

Les femmes sont employées comme salariées dans une proportion encore plus importante que les hommes, 85 % en 2017, contre 71,4 % chez les hommes. La part de l’emploi salarié a augmenté a un rythme beaucoup plus rapide chez les femmes que chez les hommes au cours de la décennie ; cette €volution s’est faite au prix d’une baisse de la contribution des femmes aux taches ménagéres (3,7 % en 2017) et au travail a leur compte (8,0 % en 2017), tandis que la part des femmes employeurs a légérement augmenté (2,5 % en 2017). Le secteur des services emploie prés de 60 % des femmes salariées et moins de 50 % des hommes salariés. En 2017, environ 6 % des femmes travaillant pour un salaire étaient employées dans l’agriculture, contre plus de 9 % chez les hommes ; ces deux parts ont augmenté au fil du temps de plus de 20 % (Graphique 2.35). Le secteur textile, qui attirait beaucoup plus de femmes que d’hommes, a supprimé des emplois et employait environ 20 % des femmes salariées en 2017, tandis que le reste\n\ndu secteur secondaire (autres industries manufacturiéres, construction et services publics) représentait environ 15 % de l'emploi salarié des femmes (Graphique 2.36 panel b). La part des femmes salariées employées dans le secteur secondaire a diminué de plus de 15 %, tandis que celle des hommes a augmenté de 5 % grace au réle du secteur de la construction. La tendance inverse a été détectée dans le secteur des services sur la période 2006-17. La part des femmes salariées dans le secteur des services a augmenté de 10 %, tandis que celle des hommes a diminué d’environ 7 %. Le commerce, l’immobilier et les services spécialisés, l’administration publique et les services de santé et d’enseignement ont été les moteurs de la croissance de l’emploi salarié dans le secteur des services chez les femmes. En 2017, 32 % des femmes salariées étaient employées dans I’administration publique et dans les services de santé et d’enseignement, suivis par les autres services (8,6 %), le commerce (7,3 %) et les services immobiliers et professionnels (4,8 %). Dans le secteur des services, les hommes forment des parts plus importantes de travailleurs salariés dans le commerce, les transports et les hétels et services de restauration.

La part des femmes dans les emplois hautement qualifiés, y compris les hauts fonctionnaires, le personnel professionnel et les techniciens, est passée de 10,0 % en 2006 a 18,4 % en 2017 et est considérablement plus élevée que la part chez les hommes travaillant pour un salaire (a 10,2 % en 2017, Graphique 2.37, panel a).

Comme dans le secteur privé, la part des hommes occupant des emplois hautement qualifiés a diminué, passant de 44 % a 38 %, tandis que les emplois moyennement qualifiés ont gagné en importance grace a l’augmentation\n\nde la part des travailleurs des services et de la vente, qui est passée de 8,8 % 430 %. Les femmes, tant dans le secteur privé que dans le secteur public, sont, en moyenne, plus instruites que les hommes. Au fil du temps, l’amélioration du niveau de scolarité de la population s’est reflétée dans la population active. Les filles dépassent désormais les garcons en termes de résultats scolaires et, en moyenne, les femmes actives sont plus instruites que les hommes actifs. Si on restreint échantillon aux salariés, qui constituent la grande majorité de la population active, plus de 20,0 % des femmes du secteur privé avaient un dipléme de l’enseignement supérieur en 2017, contre 7,8 % en 2006 ; cette part était deux fois moins importante chez les hommes (10,3 % en 2017) (Graphique 2.38, panels a et b). Laugmentation de la part des femmes diplémées de l’enseignement supérieur a correspondu a une baisse de la part des femmes actives ayant achevé leur scolarité primaire et secondaire, tandis que la part des femmes n’ayant pas fait d’études a diminué plus lentement, passant de 12,0 % 4 10,7 %. Par rapport au secteur privé, la part des femmes diplémées de l’enseignement supérieur dans le secteur public était beaucoup plus élevée, estimée a 63,3 % en 2017, contre 53,6 % en 2007 (Graphique 2.38, panels c et d). Chez les hommes, cette part est restée constante au fil du temps et était estimée a 32,1 % en 2017, soit plus de 30 points de\n\npourcentage de moins que chez les femmes. Les femmes travaillent, en moyenne, moins d’heures dans un emploi salarié que les hommes. Les femmes salariées travaillaient en moyenne environ 41 heures par semaine, contre 44 heures par semaine pour les hommes salariés (Graphique 2.39 panel a). De méme, les femmes indépendantes travaillent en moyenne 38 heures par semaine, contre 46 heures pour les hommes (Graphique 2.39 panel b ; encadré 2.5). Parmi les travailleurs indépendants, les travailleurs familiaux collaborant a l’entreprise familiale travaillent en moyenne peu d’heures ; les femmes travaillent\n\nen moyenne 36 heures et les hommes 42. Les emplois salariés du secteur public et les emplois non salariés offrent une plus grande flexibilité dans les horaires de travail. Les femmes (et les hommes) travaillant dans le secteur privé travaillent en moyenne plus longtemps que\n\nleurs homologues du secteur public. Plus précisément, les\n\nfemmes salariées du secteur public travaillent en moyenne 33 heures, alors que celles employées dans le secteur privé sont au travail prés de 44 heures en moyenne. En outre, le secteur public offre la possibilité de travailler moins qu’a temps plein, un grand nombre de femmes travaillant environ 20 heures par semaine (Graphique 2.40). Environ 32 % des femmes travaillent entre 40 et 47 heures par semaine et 22 % 48 heures par semaine ou plus. Dans le secteur privé, la part des femmes travaillant 48 heures par semaine ou plus est considérablement plus élevée, estimée 4 52 %. Les emplois non salariés offrent également la possibilité de travailler un nombre inférieur d’heures par semaine, et prés dune femme sur deux travaillant 4 son compte travaille\n\nmoins de 40 heures (Graphique 2.39- panel b). Contraintes liées a la participation des femmes au marché du travail\n\nCette section résume les contraintes qui pésent sur la participation des femmes au marché du travail en Tunisie, sur la base d’un examen d’ouvrages spécialisés et de la documentation paralléle disponibles et de l’analyse de données, en puisant notamment dans les bases de données gérées par OCDE et la Banque mondiale. Le point de départ est le cadre conceptuel décrit par Chakravarty, Das et Vaillant (2017), qui distingue trois grandes catégories de contraintes : (1) les facteurs contextuels (2) les dotations, et (3) les préférences (Graphique 2.41). Les deux derniers (dotations et préférences) sont des contraintes a l’offre de travail des femmes, tandis que le premier (facteurs contextuels) comprend 4 la fois des contraintes du cété de la demande et de offre. Dans l’esprit de Pimkina et de la Flor (2020), la discussion des facteurs contextuels est étoffée par inclusion des forces macroéconomiques, telles que les tendances économiques plus larges et les changements structurels, qui peuvent, dans certains contextes, pousser les femmes 4 intégrer la population active. La notion de boucle de rétroaction dynamique fait partie intégrante de ce cadre conceptuel. Par exemple, Pévolution des traditions culturelles concernant la division des rdles masculins et féminins dans la société peut exercer une influence sur les préférences des femmes en matiére d’emploi du temps et de structure familiale. De méme, les changements structurels (c’est-a-dire l’évolution de la demande de main-d’ceuvre selon les secteurs) peuvent inciter a investir dans les compétences ou a modifier les traditions culturelles concernant les types d’emplois\n\nconsidérés comme appropriés pour les femmes.

Entre 2006 et 2017, la part du travail indépendant dans l'emploi total a diminué de plus de 20 %, passant de 32,0 % a 24,4 %. La transition du travail indépendant au travail salarié a été plus rapide chez les femmes que chez les hommes. La part des femmes indépendantes a diminué de moitié et était estimée a 14 % de I’emploi total des femmes en 2017, alors que cette part est deux fois plus importante chez les hommes. La diminution de la part du travail indépendant s’est produite grace a une réduction sensible de la part des travailleurs familiaux non rémunérés et des travailleurs a leur compte, tandis que la part des employeurs a augmenté autant chez les hommes que chez les femmes. En 2017, environ 2,5 (8,0) % des femmes actives étaient employeurs (travailleuses a leur compte) par rapport a 7,5 (18,0) % des hommes. Malgré une baisse substantielle, la prévalence des travailleurs familiaux non rémunérés reste plus élevée chez les femmes que chez les hommes : 3,7 % contre 2,5 % en 2017. Les femmes travaillant en tant qu’employeurs et a leur compte sont passées de |’agriculture au secteur des services (Graphique B 2.2). En 2017, 60 % de ces femmes étaient employées dans les services, notamment dans le commerce, 20 % dans l’agriculture et 20 % dans le secteur secondaire, principalement dans le textile et la production agroalimentaire. La part des hommes employeurs et des travailleurs a leur compte dans l’agriculture a également diminué ; cette part était estimée a 32 % en 2017. Bien qu'une réaffectation similaire soit observée parmi les travailleurs familiaux non remunérés (annexe Graphique A 2.2), les travailleurs familiaux non rémunérés, hommes et femmes, sont encore en grande partie employés dans |’agriculture : 74,0 % des femmes et 59,4 % des hommes en 2017. Le transfert vers le secteur des services s'est traduit principalement par une augmentation de la part des travailleurs non remunérés dans le commerce. Les employeurs et les travailleurs a leur compte sont répartis par niveau de scolarité de la méme maniére que la population active 4 temps plein par sexe, bien qu’il y ait de grandes différences parmi les travailleurs familiaux non rémunérés (voir annexe Graphique A 2.3 Graphique A 2.4). Chez les hommes, on observe une forte concentration de travailleurs ayant achevé leur scolarité primaire ou secondaire. La proportion d’hommes travailleurs familiaux non rémunérés et ayant suivi des études secondaires est passée d’environ 42 % a plus de 57 % entre 2006 et 2007, contre 35 % pour I’ensemble de la population active. Chez les femmes, si la distribution des travailleurs familiaux non rémunérés par niveau de scolarité ne différe pas considérablement par rapport a la population active générale, 19 % des femmes occupant ce type d’emploi sont titulaires d'un dipléme universitaire. Cela montre que les travailleurs familiaux non rémunérés constituent un groupe trés hétérogéne. 75\n\n(suite)\n\nENCADRE 2.5.

Le score de la Tunisie s’est considérablement amélioré — passant de 58,75 a l’actuel 67,5 sur 100 en 2018 — aprés que le parlement tunisien a adopté en 2017 une loi historique\n\n(loi n° 2017-58) visant a éliminer la violence a l’égard des femmes et des filles (ONU Femmes 2017).?> La loi, qui prend en compte différents types de violence (c’est-a-dire la violence physique, économique, sexuelle, politique et psychologique) et prévoit des mécanismes institutionnels pour la protection des victimes, a été amplement reconnue comme une étape importante, bien que la mise en ceuvre et Papplication peuvent s’avérer moins strictes que la loi elle-méme (Boukhayatia 2018). Malgré ces améliorations du cadre juridique, il existe encore plusieurs domaines de la législation qui désavantagent les opportunités économiques des femmes par rapport a celles des hommes. Le pays obtient de bons résultats pour les scores secondaires relatifs 4 la mobilité, au lieu de travail et a la retraite (100/100), mais des résultats nettement moins bons quant aux indicateurs relatifs a la rémunération (25/100), au mariage (60/100), a la parentalité (40/100), a lentrepreneuriat (75/100) et au patrimoine (40/100) (Graphique 2.43).

Congé de maternité et protection des travailleuses enceintes : La Tunisie accorde aux méres environ 30 jours de congé\n\nde maternité, ce qui est nettement inférieur a la norme\n\nde 14 semaines de congé de maternité recommandée par POrganisation internationale du travail (OIT). Dans tous les pays, la durée du congé de maternité est fortement corrélée avec l’emploi des femmes dans le secteur privé (voir Amin et Islam 2019).

Accés au marché du travail : coup de projecteur sur les femmes et les jeunes\n\nil n’existe pas de systéme de congé parental rémunéré, c’est-a-dire un congé partagé entre la mére et le pére ou un droit individuel que chaque parent peut prendre indépendamment de l’autre pour s’occuper de jeunes enfants. Des données provenant d’autres pays, pour la plupart a revenu élevé, suggérent qu’un systéme de congé parental bien congcu, surtout s’il comprend certains éléments pour inciter les péres a l’utiliser (par exemple, des mois bonus ou des « quotas de papas »), peut conduire a un partage plus équitable du travail rémunéré et non\n\nrémunéré entre les parents (Patnaik 2019). Propriété des biens : Comme dans la plupart des pays de la région, les lois tunisiennes concernant l’héritage se basent sur la charia islamique et ne prévoient pas l’égalité des droits d’héritage entre les survivants (conjoints hommes et femmes ou entre les fils et les filles). En novembre 2018, le cabinet tunisien a adopté un projet de loi visant a modifier le Code du statut personnel afin d’intégrer systématiquement Pégalité des sexes en matiére d’héritage. Cependant, le projet de loi, qui a été présenté au Parlement en février 2019, n’a pas réussi a recueillir le soutien nécessaire (HRW 2018 ; Tanner 2020). En outre, le régime matrimonial par défaut est la séparation des biens, et aucune loi ne reconnait explicitement les contributions non monétaires aux biens matrimoniaux (par exemple, la contribution d’un conjoint au foyer qui s’occupe des enfants ou des taches ménagéres). Les régimes de séparation de biens, dans lesquels tous les biens sont détenus individuellement, sont généralement moins favorables aux femmes que les régimes de communauté de biens, dans lesquels la plupart des biens acquis pendant le mariage sont détenus conjointement. La communauté de biens, qui reconnait le réle des femmes dans l’accumulation des biens conjugaux par ’éducation des enfants et l’accomplissement d’autres travaux non rémunérés, est particuliérement importante dans les systémes juridiques qui ne prévoient pas l’égalité des droits de succession entre hommes et femmes, car les veuves ne peuvent pas automatiquement revendiquer la propriété des biens de leur mari décédé (Deere et Doss 2006). Dans Pensemble, les données internationales suggérent qu’il existe une forte corrélation entre des lois plus équitables en matiére de propriété et la probabilité que les femmes possédent des terres et des logements (Gaddis, Lahoti et Swaminathan 2020). Lois anti-discrimination : Si le code juridique tunisien interdit la discrimination dans l’emploi fondée sur le genre il n’existe pas de dispositions spécifiques imposant un\n\ntravail égal pour une valeur égale afin de protéger contre\n\nla discrimination salariale. De méme, il n’existe pas de lois interdisant la discrimination dans I’accés au crédit fondée\n\nsur le genre. Facteurs macroéconomiques\n\nUne abondance d’études académiques analyse la relation entre la croissance et le développement économiques, les changements structurels et la participation des femmes au marché du travail (par exemple, Gaddis et Klasen 2014 ; Goldin 1990, 1995 ; Klasen et coll. 2021 ; Mammen et Paxson 2000). Lexamen détaillé de cette documentation dépasse Pobjectif de ce chapitre, mais quatre idées clés potentiellement pertinentes pour le contexte du pays\n\ntunisien sont désormais synthétisées. Tout d’abord, il existe des exemples de pays, notamment en Asie, ot de nouvelles possibilités d’emploi dans des secteurs croissants de l’économie ont été associées a des augmentations de la participation des femmes au marché du travail (Klasen 2019b). Par exemple, il a été avancé que l’expansion de l’industrie manufacturiére légére (par exemple, le textile, ’habillement, les chaussures) peut étre un moteur de l’augmentation de la participation des femmes au marché du travail dans certaines parties de l’Asie de Est et du Sud (Heath et Mobarak 2015 ; Seguino 2000). De méme, certains éléments indiquent que la croissance des secteurs et professions de services a créé des possibilités d’emploi pour les femmes hautement qualifiées en Amérique latine et en Inde (Gasparini et Marchionni 2015 ; Klasen et Pieters 2015). Si les conditions sont favorables, l’augmentation de l’emploi des femmes en raison de nouvelles opportunités économiques peut déclencher un cycle vertueux d’incitations a investir dans les compétences et a retarder l’Age du mariage (voir Heath et Mobarak 2015 sur le Bangladesh). En outre,\n\nPaugmentation de l’emploi des femmes peut conduire a\n\ndes niveaux plus élevés de prise de décision par les femmes au sein du ménage, ce qui pourrait remettre en question les roles traditionnels de genre (Majlesi 2016). Deuxiémement, malgré ces possibilités de boucles de rétroaction positives et les expériences positives de quelques pays (principalement asiatiques), l’évolution dans la participation des femmes au marché du travail qui peut étre attribuée a la croissance économique et aux changements structurels sont généralement assez faibles. Gaddis et Klasen (2014) utilisent les données de 200 pays pour étudier la relation empirique entre la croissance par\n\nsecteur et la participation de la main-d’ceuvre féminine\n\n80\n\nentre 1980 et 2005 et simulent la part de l’évolution de la participation de la main-d’ceuvre féminine sur cette période susceptible d’étre liée a la croissance par secteur. Les résultats suggérent qu’un peu moins de 10 % (c’est- a-dire 1 point de pourcentage) de l’augmentation de 11 points de pourcentage de la participation des femmes au marché du travail dans les pays de |’échantillon est liée a des changements structurels. De méme, les variations du PIB global par habitant (méme en tenant compte d’une relation non linéaire) expliquent peu la variation de la participation des femmes au marché du travail a l’échelle nationale, par rapport aux effets fixes du pays (Gaddis et Klasen 2014). Cela suggére qu’il existe d’importants déterminants historiques de la participation des femmes au marché du travail qui sont trés persistants dans le temps et éclipsent les changements associés a la croissance et aux changements structurels (Klasen 2019b).?” De méme, la Banque mondiale (2020b) montre que les augmentations durables de la participation des femmes au marché du travail a partir de leur faible niveau de départ sont\n\nrelativement rares. Troisiémement, certaines études documentent le caractére anticyclique de la participation des femmes au marché du travail (Bhalotra et Umafia-Aponte 2010 ; Serrano et coll. 2019). De méme, on a souvent constaté que l’emploi et la participation au marché du travail des femmes augmentaient en période de ralentissement économique et de récession (Sabarwal, Sinha et Buvini¢é 2011 ; Lim 2000).?* Lune des explications de ce phénoméne est effet du travailleur supplémentaire, qui renvoie a une augmentation temporaire de l’offre de travail des femmes mariées en raison d’une perte d’emploi ou de revenu de leur mari (Lundberg 1985). Dans le contexte des pays en développement, de forts effets de travailleurs ajoutés ont été documentés en Amérique latine (par exemple, Cardona-Sosa, Flérez et Zurita 2016 sur la Colombie ; Fernandes et de Felicio 2005 sur le Brésil ; Skoufias et Parker 2006 sur le Mexique). Cependant, il ne semble pas y avoir d’études sur la région MENA.”\n\nPar exemple, Alesina, Giuliano et Nunn (2013) montrent que les pratiques agricoles traditionnelles sont corrélées aux différences actuelles dans les traditions et les coutumes liées aux rdles masculins et féminins, ce qui peut expliquer certaines des différences persistantes entre les pays en matiére de participation des femmes au marché du travail. 28La récession induite par la pandémie de COVID-19 est cependant différente. Dans de nombreux pays, l'emploi des femmes a diminué de maniére disproportionnée pendant la pandémie. Un facteur explicatif possible est que les fermetures d’écoles pendant les périodes de confinement ont exercé une pression supplémentaire sur la responsabilité des taches ménagéres et d’éducation des enfants et ont renforcé les réles et divisions traditionnelles des hommes et des femmes a la maison (Alon et coll. 2020 ; Kugler et coll."

        "2021). »*TIkkaracan (2012) documente un effet de travailleur ajouté en Turquie. Paysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nQuatriémement, et en relation avec le point précédent, la participation des femmes au marché du travail, en particulier des femmes pauvres ayant un faible niveau d’études, diminue souvent lorsque les revenus des autres membres du ménage augmentent (Klasen et coll. 2021). Cette relation, qui est conforme a la théorie standard de Poffre de main-d’ceuvre, semble étre ’une des principales forces a l’origine du déclin de la participation des femmes au marché du travail en Inde (Klasen et Pieters 2015). Dans l’ensemble, ces deux derniers points suggérent que les femmes pauvres dans de nombreux pays en développement ont un faible attachement au marché du travail et se retirent volontiers si elles peuvent se le\n\npermettre sur le plan économique. Qu’est-ce que cela implique pour la Tunisie ? La croissance économique en Tunisie a été modeste ces derniers temps, et les changements structurels ont progressé lentement. En outre, ’emploi dans les secteurs du textile et de Phabillement, qui ont été associés 4 une augmentation de la participation des femmes au marché du travail dans certaines régions d’Asie, a diminué ces derniéres années en raison de la forte concurrence des fabricants asiatiques dont les cofits salariaux sont moins élevés. Le secteur des services pourrait offrir des possibilités de croissance de Pemploi, notamment dans le tourisme et l'économie des soins a la personne, étant donné le vieillissement de la population du pays. En outre, ces secteurs pourraient offrir des possibilités d’emploi aux femmes ayant un faible niveau d’études. Cependant, la croissance de l’emploi des femmes dans le tourisme a jusqu’a présent été limitée par la mauvaise réputation du secteur, les restrictions a la mobilité des femmes et l’insuffisance des services de soutien aux familles. Lensemble de ces éléments suggére que la croissance et les changements structurels pourraient contribuer a accroitre la participation des femmes au marché du travail dans un avenir proche, en particulier s’ils s’accompagnent d’une atténuation de certaines des autres contraintes a la participation des femmes. A moyen et long terme, l’effet de revenu attribuable 4 la hausse du niveau de vie associée aux gains plus élevés des hommes pourrait atténuer ces impacts positifs sur la participation des femmes au marché du travail, en particulier chez les femmes peu\n\ninstruites et peu attachées au marché du travail. Discrimination\n\nSi les employeurs pratiquent une discrimination a l’égard des femmes, cela est susceptible de réduire a néant le\n\npotentiel d’augmentation de l’emploi des femmes en\n\nAccés au marché du travail : coup de projecteur sur les femmes et les jeunes\n\nraison de la hausse de la demande de main-d’ceuvre, surtout si la discrimination se produit dans les secteurs en expansion. S’il est difficile de trouver des preuves directes de discrimination, certains éléments indiquent que des pratiques discriminatoires existent et peuvent désavantager les femmes. Karkkainen (2011) indique que 60 % des hétels et 40 % des entreprises de technologies de l'information et de la communication (TIC) interrogés indiquaient leur préférence quant au sexe des candidats lors du processus de recrutement du personnel, méme si cette pratique est proscrite. En outre, de nombreuses entreprises ont apparemment exprimé une préférence envers les femmes célibataires plutét que pour les femmes mariées, car les femmes mariées étaient considérées comme plus cofiteuses et moins productives, notamment pendant la maternité. Méme si l’étude commence 4 dater, il semble plausible qu’au moins certaines de ces pratiques aient perduré. De méme, la Banque mondiale (2014b) montre que plus de 60 % des jeunes femmes des zones rurales de Tunisie ont exprimé la préoccupation que les femmes étaient discriminées dans la recherche d’un emploi dans le secteur privé ; la part est plus faible dans le travail dans le\n\nsecteur public (44 %), mais elle reste élevée.*°\n\nLa discrimination peut étre renforcée par l’insuffisance du recours juridique des victimes. Le code juridique tunisien ne prévoit pas de dispositions imposant un travail égal pour une valeur égale ou interdisant la discrimination fondée sur le genre en matiére d’accés au crédit (Banque mondiale 2021c). Traditions culturelles et coutumes\n\nOutre les inégalités entre les hommes et les femmes dans le code juridique, les traditions culturelles et les coutumes attribuent aux hommes le réle de soutien de famille, tandis que les femmes sont censées s’occuper des enfants e d’assurer d’autres taches familiales non rémunérées. Selon les données de l’enquéte World Values Survey 2019 en Tunisie, 58 % des femmes et 73 % des hommes sont d’accord avec l’affirmation suivante : « Lorsque les emplois sont rares, les hommes devraient avoir la priorité de l'emploi sur les femmes » (Graphique 2.44, panel a). De méme, 69 % des femmes et 74 % des hommes sont d’accord avec l’affirmation selon laquelle « Un enfant d’Age préscolaire souffre du fait que sa mére travaille »\n\n(Graphique 2.44 panel b). Laccord est un peu moins\n\n% Parmi les jeunes hommes ruraux, 44 (32) pour cent pergoivent une discrimination a P’égard des femmes dans le secteur public (privé). marqué pour l’affirmation « Les hommes font de meilleurs cadres que les femmes », avec laquelle 37 % des femmes et 52 % des hommes sont d’accord, et pour l’affirmation « Aller 4 Puniversité est plus important pour un garcon que pour une fille », avec laquelle 19 % des femmes et 31 % des hommes sont d’accord (Graphique 2.44 panels c et d). Les résultats montrent également que, méme si les opinions conservatrices sont répandues autant chez les hommes que chez les femmes, ces derniéres adoptent des opinions relativement plus égalitaires. La ventilation des résultats de l’enquéte sur les valeurs mondiales montre par ailleurs que les jeunes femmes en particulier sont moins susceptibles d’étre en accord avec les attitudes conservatrices concernant la division des roles masculins et féminins. Graphique 2.45 représente les coefficients d’une analyse de régression linéaire, dans laquelle une augmentation de la variable dépendante indique des opinions davantage en faveur de Dégalité hommes femmes. Les femmes de 15 4 29 ans sont nettement plus susceptibles que les femmes plus agées (50 ans et plus) de ne pas étre en accord avec les affirmations selon lesquelles les hommes ont plus de droits a ’emploi que les femmes, les enfants d’Age préscolaire souffrent lorsque leur mére travaille et les hommes font de meilleurs cadres que les femmes. II n’y a pas de relation significative entre l’Age dune femme et la probabilité qu’elle soit en désaccord avec l’affirmation selon laquelle il est plus important pour un garcon d’aller a Puniversité que pour une fille, mais les répondants sont généralement peu en faveur de cette affirmation, en particulier la population féminine (voir Graphique 2.44 tableau d). Chez les hommes, il n’y a pas de différences d’Age significatives dans les opinions, ce qui indique que les croyances traditionnelles quant aux réles typiquement masculins et féminins restent bien ancrées chez les jeunes hommes. Cependant, les régressions montrent que les niveaux d’études supérieures (enseignement supérieur) sont corrélés avec des attitudes moins conservatrices, un lien observé a la fois chez les hommes et les femmes, bien que les coefficients ne soient souvent que légérement inférieurs 4 la marge de 5 % pour étre significatives sur le plan statistique. Il n’y a pas de relation forte entre les attitudes conservatrices et le nombre d’enfants dans le ménage, sauf pour l’affirmation « aller 4 ’université est plus important pour un garcon que pour une fille », avec laquelle les femmes avec enfants sont plus susceptibles d’étre en\n\ndésaccord que les femmes sans enfants.

Des études récentes menées par |’équipe des sciences comportementales de la Banque mondiale examinent si la répartition du temps des hommes et des femmes entre travail rémunéré et non rémunéré est déterminée par des normes sociales ou des traditions et coutumes culturelles (Banque mondiale 2021a).

Notamment, aussi bien les hommes que les femmes sont favorables a la participation des hommes aux travaux ménagers, ce qui suggére que les disparités observées dans la répartition de leurs emplois du temps respectifs ne sont pas motivées par une norme\n\nsociale, mais plutét par les coutumes et les traditions.*! Sécurité\n\nLactivité économique des femmes peut étre restreinte par le risque de harcélement et de violence ou dans l’espace public, qui est souvent exacerbé par le manque de transports publics stirs (Pimkina et de la Flor 2020). Le harcélement sexuel et les problémes de sécurité sont parfois signalés comme des contraintes a la participation des femmes au marché du travail (Assaad et Barsoum 2019 ; Banque mondiale 2014b). Cependant, il existe peu de données quantitatives sur la prévalence de ce lien. En termes de perceptions, l’enquéte World Values Survey de 2019 menée en Tunisie montre que prés de 27 % des femmes et 30 % des hommes déclarent que les occurrences de harcélement sexuel sont fréquentes dans leur communauté (Graphique 2.46). Les données qualitatives soutiennent l’idée que le harcélement public dans les rues, qui peut inclure des appels ou des attouchements non souhaités, est une source préoccupation importante chez les jeunes femmes, en particulier dans les transports publics, et que les problémes de sécurité limitent la mobilité des jeunes femmes aprés la tombée de la nuit (Jesse 2017). Karkkdinen (2011) documente que\n\n3']] faut étre prudent car la composition de l’échantillon est biaisée en faveur des femmes célibataires relativement jeunes, instruites et vivant en milieu urbain. Ces femmes affichent généralement des taux élevés de participation au marché du travail et sont potentiellement moins affectées par les normes sociales et les coutumes dans leur comportement. les préoccupations relatives au harcélement sexuel sur le lieu de travail limitent les types d’emplois pour lesquels les femmes postulent dans l'industrie du tourisme ; de nombreuses femmes, par exemple, évitent les emplois dans les bars ou les cuisines. Ces préoccupations peuvent étre amplifiées par les traditions culturelles qui considérent les femmes comme les gardiennes des convenances sociales, de la moralité et de ’honneur de la famille. Par exemple, les emplois qui impliquent un contact direct avec des clients, des collégues ou des supérieurs masculins peuvent\n\nétre considérés, 4 premiére vue, comme des menaces pour la réputation des femmes (OIT 2018b ; Jesse 2017). Comme dans de nombreux pays, la violence a l’égard des femmes en Tunisie, plus précisément les mauvais traitements infligés aux femmes et la violence domestique a Pégard des femmes, semble avoir augmenté pendant la pandémie de COVID-19. Selon une enquéte en ligne menée en juin-juillet 2020, 37 % des femmes et 28 % des hommes ont déclaré que la violence dans leur communauté avait augmenté pendant le COVID-19 (Banque mondiale 202 1a). Si cette tendance est profondément préoccupante, les conséquences a plus long terme, notamment sur le comportement des femmes sur le marché du travail, sont\n\nincertaines. DOTATIONS\n\nLes différences en matiére de dotations humaines et physiques entre les hommes et les femmes constituent une autre contrainte potentielle a la participation des femmes au marché du travail. Le terme de dotations est considéré de maniére assez large comme des dotations en capital humain (enseignement et compétences), la propriété, le contréle et l’accés aux ressources productives (actifs, crédit),\n\net Paccés aux réseaux et a ’information. 85\n\n86\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nGRAPHIQUE 2.47.

Outre les disparités entre les hommes et les femmes dans Penseignement formel, certains éléments indiquent que les femmes sont désavantagées par rapport aux hommes dans l’apprentissage en milieu de travail. Par exemple, les jeunes femmes interrogées lors de discussions de groupe en 2012 ont indiqué que les préoccupations de la famille concernant la sécurité des femmes et les restrictions sociétales sur leur mobilité les empéchaient d’occuper ces emplois occasionnels et d’appoint qui aident souvent les jeunes hommes a acquérir des compétences pertinentes et une expérience du marché du travail de premier niveau (Banque mondiale 2014b). Propriété de biens et autres actifs productifs et accés au capital\n\nIl existe des écarts importants entre les hommes et les femmes en matiére de contréle des ressources productives. Les recherches menées par l’OIT (2018b) en 2017 a aide de la méthodologie de Vindice d’autonomisation des femmes dans l’agriculture montrent que les femmes sont beaucoup moins susceptibles que les hommes de déclarer posséder des actifs productifs, en particulier des terres agricoles et des moyens de transport motorisés.* Dans les zones rurales, 27 % des hommes ont déclaré posséder des\n\nterres agricoles, contre seulement 6 % des femmes. Dans le\n\nMéme si l’enquéte est représentative au niveau national des ménages, elle a suréchantillonné les chefs de famille et les conjoints en menant des entretiens individuels. Lenquéte n’est donc pas nécessairement représentative au niveau de la population. domaine des transports, 13 % des hommes en milieu rural et 20 % des hommes en milieu urbain ont déclaré posséder une voiture, contre seulement 2 % des femmes en milieu rural et 5 % des femmes en milieu urbain (Graphique 2.48). Ces écarts, qui sont similaires pour le fait de posséder une moto, peuvent étre un facteur expliquant pourquoi les femmes sont généralement moins mobiles sur le plan géographique que les hommes. Les disparités entre les hommes et les femmes en matiére de propriété de terrains a batir, d’immobilier et d’entreprises familiales non agricoles sont moins importantes, mais favorisent également les hommes. Les disparités entre les hommes et les femmes en matiére de propriété sont en partie liées aux inégalités entre les hommes et les femmes dans le systéme juridique qui désavantagent les femmes dans l’accumulation de\n\nbiens par le mariage et l’héritage. Les femmes sont beaucoup moins susceptibles que les hommes d’utiliser des produits financiers, tels que les comptes dépargne, le crédit et les préts. Ainsi, 46 % des hommes ont déclaré avoir des comptes dans des institutions financiéres, contre seulement 28 % des femmes (Graphique 2.49). De méme, beaucoup moins de femmes que d’hommes ont épargné auprés d’institutions financiéres (14 % contre 23 %) ou ont emprunté pour démarrer, exploiter ou développer une entreprise (11 % contre 5 %). Les comptes d’argent mobile ne sont pas si communs en Tunisie et n’ont été mentionnés par seulement 2 % des hommes et des femmes. Rien n’indique non plus que les disparités entre les hommes et les femmes en matiére d’accés au financement diminuent 4 mesure que l’accés généralisé s’améliore. Si Pinclusion financiére était globalement plus grande en 2017 qu’en 2014, les disparités entre les hommes et les\n\nfemmes étaient également, voire |égérement plus. 87\n\n88\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nGRAPHIQUE 2.49.

Remarque : Le graphique montre la part (%) des hommes et des femmes de 15 ans et plus qui déclarent avoir participé a l’activité indiquée\n\nLes disparités entre les hommes et les femmes en matiére d’accés au financement reflétent en partie les attitudes sociales et culturelles a l’égard de la division des réles masculins et féminins dans la société, qui privilégie la présence des hommes sur le marché du travail et leurs investissements productifs en priorité sur ceux des femmes. Par exemple, 18 % des hommes ruraux et 21 % des hommes urbains déclarent étre libres d’emprunter auprés d’une institution financiére, contre seulement 8 % des femmes rurales et 6 % des femmes urbaines. Une évaluation récente de impact d’un projet de subventions en espéces ciblant les femmes pauvres dans les zones rurales de Tunisie a révélé que intervention n’a pas eu d’impact significatif sur le revenu des femmes, mais qu’elle a pu avoir un effet positif sur les activités génératrices de revenus des autres membres du ménage. Cela suggére que les fonds, bien qu’ostensiblement destinés aux femmes, étaient principalement utilisés pour promouvoir les activités génératrices de revenus des maris et des autres membres du ménage (Ferrah et coll. 2021). Ces traditions culturelles sont renforcées par l’absence d’une protection juridique robuste des droits des femmes, par exemple, l’absence de dispositions légales interdisant la discrimination des\n\nfemmes en matiére d’accés au crédit. Réseaux\n\nLes femmes sont désavantagées dans |’accés aux réseaux et aux informations. La part des femmes rurales qui déclarent étre libres d’adhérer a des groupes divers, tels que des groupes religieux, des groupes civiques, des associations\n\nculturelles, des clubs sportifs et des partis politiques, se situe\n\nentre 32 % et 38 %, contre 53 % a 56 % chez les hommes (OIT 2018b).** Ces disparités entre les hommes et les femmes sont moins marquées dans les zones urbaines, mais restent observables. Il n’y a presque pas de disparités entre les hommes et les femmes dans la capacité a rejoindre des groupes parmi les jeunes, sauf dans les clubs sportifs, o les femmes continuent d’étre désavantagées. Cela indique que ces contraintes affectent de maniére disproportionnée les générations de femmes plus agées, en particulier dans\n\nles zones rurales. Cependant, méme parmi les jeunes Tunisiens, l’accés aux réseaux peut désavantager les femmes 4 la recherche d’un emploi. Les jeunes femmes diplémées indiquent qu’elles ont peu d’occasions de se sociabiliser et de se constituer un réseau en dehors du foyer et du marché, ce qui peut les désavantager dans l’accés aux opportunités du marché du travail (Banque mondiale 2014b). De méme, des entretiens avec des jeunes femmes dans les secteurs des TIC et du tourisme ont révélé que nombre d’entre elles se sentaient désavantagées par les pratiques de recrutement standard, selon lesquelles les informations sur les postes 4 pourvoir étaient diffusées de maniére informelle ou par des contacts\n\npersonnels (Karkkdinen 2011). Compte tenu des restrictions culturelles a la mobilité des femmes 4 l’extérieur du foyer, les femmes pourraient\n\npotentiellement bénéficier de l’accés aux TIC. Pour cela,\n\n“Méme parmi les hommes, une part importante a déclaré qu’ils n’étaient pas libres de rejoindre des groupes. Des recherches supplémentaires sont nécessaires pour clarifier les contraintes qui pésent sur les choix des hommes dans ce contexte. Accés au marché du travail : coup de projecteur sur les femmes et les jeunes\n\nil faudrait que l’accés aux TIC soit relativement équitable pour les hommes et les femmes. Les données ne sont pas concluantes. Une proportion beaucoup plus importante de jeunes hommes que de jeunes femmes ont déclaré utiliser internet réguliérement (78 % contre 32 %, respectivement). Toutefois, il n’y a pas d’écart marqué entre les hommes et les femmes en ce qui concerne la participation aux discussions en ligne (46 % chez les hommes contre 43 % chez les femmes) ou les comptes Facebook (99 % chez les hommes contre 98 % chez les femmes), ce qui indique que la plupart des jeunes femmes ont un certain accés aux TIC,\n\nmais peut-étre pas aussi réguliérement que les hommes. PREFERENCES ET CHOIX\n\nCette section traite des différences entre les hommes et les femmes dans les types d’emplois qu’ils et elles semblent préférer. Ces différences de préférences et de choix entre les hommes et les femmes ne sont manifestement pas dorigine biologique, mais découlent de traditions sociales et culturelles liées a la division des rdles masculins et\n\nféminins. Emploi du temps et structure familiale\n\nLes femmes célibataires sont plus susceptibles de faire partie de la population active que les femmes mariées, et l’écart se creuse tout au long du cycle de vie (voir Graphique 2.24). Cela suggére que le mariage et la maternité sont associés a la décision des femmes de quitter ou de ne pas intégrer la population active. En outre, les traditions et les coutumes attribuent aux femmes tunisiennes de nombreuses responsabilités en matiére d’éducation des enfants et de taches domestiques non rémunérées. Ainsi, les femmes consacrent beaucoup plus de temps que les hommes au travail non rémunéré. Les femmes déclarent consacrer environ 4 heures par jour aux taches domestiques et 2,1 heures (zones urbaines) a 2,6 heures (zones rurales) supplémentaires aux soins des enfants (Graphique 2.50). Sur une semaine, cela représente un nombre d’heures supérieur a celui d’un emploi 4 temps plein : 42,7 heures dans les zones urbaines et 46,2 heures dans les zones rurales. A l’inverse, les hommes consacrent moins d’une heure par jour aux travaux domestiques et entre 1,1 heure (urbain) et 1,4 heure (rural) par jour a Péducation des enfants (Graphique 2.50). Les hommes disposent donc de beaucoup plus de temps pour exercer une activité rémunérée (voir Graphique 2.39).

Les femmes des zones rurales travaillent également de maniére disproportionnée dans la production agricole pour leur\n\npropre consommation (Hanmer, Tebaldi et Verner 2017). Il existe des preuves tangibles que la pandémie de COVID-19 a exacerbé les différences qui existaient déja entre les hommes et les femmes en matiére d’emploi du temps. Dans une enquéte en ligne menée en juin-juillet 2020, 35 % des femmes mariées ont déclaré que le temps qu’elles avaient consacré aux taches domestiques avait augmenté depuis le début de la pandémie, contre seulement 14 % des hommes mariés (Banque mondiale 2021a). Dans le domaine de la garde d’enfants, l’augmentation autodéclarée est encore plus importante : 12 % des hommes et des femmes mariés ont déclaré consacrer plus de temps a cette activité\n\naujourd’hui qu’avant la pandémie. Ces différences entre les hommes et les femmes dans la répartition de leur emploi du temps reflétent les traditions culturelles qui attribuent aux femmes de nombreuses taches et responsabilités non rémunérées au sein du foyer. Deux femmes sur trois pensent qu’un enfant d’age préscolaire souffre du fait que sa mére travaille (voir Graphique 2.44). De méme, dans les données du Barométre arabe 2018, 58 % des femmes sont d’accord avec l’affirmation selon\n\nlaquelle il est préférable pour un ménage que la femme ait\n\n90\n\nla responsabilité principale de s’occuper du foyer et des enfants plutét que l’>homme.** Cela suggére que ces normes sont souvent intériorisées par les femmes elles-mémes. La décision des femmes de rechercher des possibilités d’emploi a l’extérieur du ménage peut étre considérée comme subversive, avec des conséquences potentiellement négatives pour les ménages et les femmes, notamment en raison de la diminution des perspectives de mariage (Banque mondiale 2014b). Dans un tel environnement, il est difficile de faire une distinction entre la division sexuelle des réles assignés par les traditions culturelles et\n\nles coutumes et les préférences individuelles. Un autre facteur qui peut influencer le temps que les femmes consacrent a des activités non rémunérées est la disponibilité et le caractére abordable des services de garde d’enfants. Les données internationales suggérent fortement qu’un meilleur accés aux services de garde d’enfants (par le biais de créches et d’écoles maternelles, de journées d’école élémentaire plus longues, etc.) permet d’augmenter de maniére significative l’emploi et la participation des femmes au marché du travail (Buvini¢ et O'Donnell 2016 ; De Henau 2019 ; Halim, Johnson et Perova 2019 ; Mateo Diaz et Rodriguez-Chamussy 2013 ; Padilla-Romo et Cabrera-Hernandez 2018). En Tunisie, la fréquentation des créches est rare chez les enfants de 3 a 36 mois (Encadré 2-6). Parmi les enfants de 3 a 6 ans, environ un sur deux fréquente une créche, avec des taux de fréquentation nettement plus élevés dans les ménages plus aisés que dans le quintile le plus pauvre (71 % contre 17 %). Si ce gradient de revenu peut refléter divers facteurs, notamment des attitudes plus conservatrices quant aux roles masculins et féminins parmi les ménages les plus pauvres (souvent ruraux), il peut également indiquer que la contrainte de cofit et de capacité financiére limitent l’accés des ménages pauvres aux services de garde d’enfants. Les frais de garde varient considérablement d’une région a lautre et d’un prestataire de services a l’autre, mais le tarif moyen de 140 DT représente plus de 30 % du salaire médian des femmes actives ayant achevé leur scolarité primaire. En outre, dans le secteur public, les lieux de travail de plus de 50 travailleurs sont tenus de disposer de structures d’accueil pour les enfants sur place, ce qui peut expliquer en partie la préférence des femmes\n\nenvers les emplois du secteur public (Moghadam 2017). Arab Barometer Public Opinion Survey Series (base de données), Inter- university Consortium for Political and Social Research, Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, http://www.icpsr.umich. edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/S08. Paysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nProfession et secteur\n\nLes préférences des femmes envers certains types d’emplois et de professions sont fagonnées par la vision sociétale des types demplois considérés comme acceptables pour les femmes et qui leur permettraient de combiner emploi et responsabilités domestiques. Comme dans de nombreux pays de la région, les femmes en Tunisie ont une forte préférence pour les emplois du secteur public par rapport au secteur privé (Mouelhi et Goaied 2018 ; Stampini et Verdier-Chouchane 2011). Les femmes sont fortement surreprésentées dans la masse salariale du secteur public. Vemploi dans le secteur public propose généralement des conditions de travail plus favorables, notamment des horaires plus courts, une plus grande sécurité de l’emploi, une couverture sociale, des congés annuels et de maladie payés, et un meilleur accés aux services de garde d’enfants (Moghadam 2018) (voir Graphique 2.40). Ces caractéristiques permettent aux femmes de concilier plus facilement travail rémunéré et travail non rémunéré et ces considérations sont donc relativement plus importantes pour les femmes que pour les\n\nhommes (Assaad et Barsoum 2019).*°\n\nMéme parmi les femmes célibataires, on observe une forte préférence pour les emplois du secteur public, car ils donnent un signal positif sur le marché du mariage. Krafft et Assaad (2020) montrent que l’emploi dans le secteur public accélére considérablement le mariage des femmes en Tunisie. Des données qualitatives montrent également que les ménages attendent des jeunes femmes qu’elles n’acceptent que des emplois jugés convenables, c’est-a-dire des emplois correspondant aux qualifications de la femme et de préférence dans le secteur public pour améliorer les\n\nperspectives de mariage (Banque mondiale 2014b). Toutefois, avec augmentation des niveaux de scolarité des femmes, cette stratégie est mise a mal, car l’éventail des possibilités d’emploi dans le secteur public est de moins en moins en phase avec le nombre de femmes dipl6mées qui recherchent ces emplois. Dans la mesure ot l’emploi formel ou informel dans le secteur privé et le travail indépendant ne sont pas considérés comme acceptables pour les femmes instruites, le chOmage et l’inactivité\n\npeuvent rester les seules options. % Feld, Nagy et Osman (2020) utilisent un plan expérimental pour obtenir des demandeurs d’emploi qu’ils évaluent divers attributs de l'emploi en Egypte. Ils montrent que les femmes sont plus sensibles aux longs trajets et qu’elles apprécient davantage les horaires de travail flexibles que les hommes. Bien que ces résultats ne concernent pas spécifiquement la Tunisie, ils soutiennent Pidée que les femmes valorisent davantage l’équilibre entre vie professionnelle et vie privée que les hommes dans un contexte culturel similaire. Accés au marché du travail : coup de projecteur sur les femmes et les jeunes\n\nENCADRE 2.6. Les créches et les structures préprimaires en Tunisie\n\nApergu des créches, des jardins d’enfants et des structures préprimaires\n\nLes enfants de 3 mois 4 3 ans fréquentent des créches. Les enfants fréquentent une structure préprimaire de 3 a 6 ans (Tableau B 2.6- et annexe Tableau A 2.2). L'enseignement préprimaire est dispensé par les organismes suivants :\n\n¢ Les écoles maternelles et les jardins d’enfants : Il s‘agit d’établissements socio-éducatifs privés ou publics ou gérés par des asso- ciations spécialisées. Les institutions publiques sont des institutions municipales relevant du ministére des Affaires locales et de l'Environnement et du ministére de la Famille, de la Femme, de I'Enfance et des Personnes agées. Les établissements privés de la petite enfance doivent s‘enregistrer et obtenir un agrément auprés du ministére de la Famille, de la Femme, de I’Enfance et des Personnes agées. Les contréles sont effectués par des inspecteurs pour vérifier le respect des normes de santé et de sécurité. ¢ Kouttabs : Il s‘agit d’institutions religieuses offrant des services d‘accueil pour les enfants de 3 a 5 ans. Les kouttabs initient les enfants au Coran et leur apprennent a lire, écrire et compter. Ils sont sous I’égide du ministére des Affaires religieuses. Ecoles primaires : Elles proposent des cours préparatoires avec une classe d’accueil pour les enfants de 5 a 6 ans. Elle fait partie intégrante de |’enseignement de base, mais n‘est pas obligatoire. Les cours sont dispensés sous I’égide du ministére de I'Education et sont proposés dans les écoles primaires publiques et privées. A ce jour, la quasi-totalité des créches et des jardins d’enfants est détenue et gérée par le secteur privé. Environ 1 % seulement de tous les enfants de 3 a 36 mois fréquentent les créches.* Le taux de fréquentation net des enfants de 3 a 6 ans est de 51 %. Ce taux est plus élevé dans les zones urbaines (63 %) que dans les zones rurales (28 %). Ce taux est également plus élevé chez les enfants issus de ménages aisés (71 %), par rapport aux enfants vivant dans les ménages les plus pauvres (17 %). L'offre du secteur privé représente 94,0 % des jardins d’enfants, contre 5,9 % pour le secteur public. Le taux net de scolarisation des enfants de 5 a 6 ans dans |’école primaire préparatoire (classe d'accueil) est de 90 % : 94 % dans les zones urbaines et 83 % dans les zones rurales.°\n\nAccés aux jardins d’enfants publics\n\nLe coat des jardins d’enfants publics se situe entre 25 et 45 TD par mois. Depuis 2010, un programme géré par le ministére de la Famille, de la Femme, de |’Enfance et des Personnes Agées permet aux ménages nécessiteux et a faible revenu d'inscrire leurs enfants dans des jardins d’enfants gratuitement pendant deux ans. Le nombre de bénéficiaires est d’environ 6 000 enfants par an. L’accés aux jardins d’enfants publics est décidé sur la base d’informations concernant le statut social du ménage et les bulletins de salaire des parents. Pour les ménages non nécessiteux, |’inscription se fait en fonction des places disponibles et du lieu de résidence. L'accés aux classes préparatoires publiques est gratuit. Coit des créches privées\n\nLe cotit des créches privées varie selon le prestataire de services. Pour estimer un cofit moyen des centres privés, une enquéte auprés des créches privées a été menée a travers les 24 gouvernorats de la Tunisie en avril 2021. Un centre a été sélectionné au hasard dans chaque gouvernorat, pour un total de 21 créches privées.* Les frais mensuels sont de |’ordre de 40 a 350 DT (Tableau B 2.6- et annexe Tableau A 2.3). La moyenne est d’environ 140 TD, mais des variations considérables existent d’une région a l'autre. Les régions du nord ont les frais mensuels les plus élevés. Cela représentait environ 27 % du salaire mensuel médian en 2019. Il représentait environ 35 % du salaire mensuel médian des femmes actives ayant achevé leur scolarité primaire. TABLEAU B 2.6.1.

        "Quelques centres n’ont pas été atteints par 'enquéte. Mobilité géographique\n\nIl est prouvé que les femmes sont moins mobiles géogra- phiquement que les hommes, ce qui limite encore leurs possibilités. Par exemple, les entreprises du secteur des TIC interrogées par Karkkainen (2011) ont indiqué que le manque de mobilité des femmes constitue un obsta- cle au recrutement et a la promotion des femmes au sein des entreprises. De méme, les entretiens avec les femmes en personne révélent des différences régionales dans la volonté de parcourir de longues distances, ce qui peut étre un facteur contribuant aux différences d’une région a Pautre dans le taux de participation des femmes au marché du travail (Hanmer, Tebaldi et Verner 2017). Plusieurs facteurs peuvent expliquer les différences dans la volonté des femmes et des hommes d’accepter des emplois qui exigent soit de déménager dans une autre ville, soit des temps de trajet plus longs. De nombreuses femmes évitent utiliser les transports publics, surtout la nuit. En outre, les femmes sont nettement moins nombreuses que les hommes a posséder un moyen de transport motorisé (voir Graphique 2.48). Les entretiens qualitatifs de la Banque mondiale (2014a) montrent que les réles masculins et féminins sous une prime conservateur peuvent limiter la capacité des jeunes femmes a occuper un emploi qui\n\nexigerait de quitter le foyer. Les contraintes de mobilité peuvent étre particuliérement\n\ngraves pour les femmes ayant un faible niveau de scolarité\n\nou issues de milieux défavorisés. Des recherches menées en Jordanie montrent qu’il existe une corrélation négative entre la participation des femmes au marché du travail et les temps de trajet domicile-travail au niveau du district, mais uniquement chez les femmes n’ayant pas atteint le niveau d’études secondaires (Kasoolu et coll. 2019). Les études montrent que les femmes ayant un faible niveau de scolarité ont recours de maniére disproportionnée aux transports publics, tandis que les femmes plus instruites sont plus susceptibles d’utiliser des transports privés, ce qui leur permet de contourner le manque de transports publics stirs. En outre, une comparaison des temps de trajet des hommes et des femmes célibataires, un segment de la population ayant comparativement peu de responsabilités domestiques, montre que les temps de trajet des femmes sont nettement plus courts que ceux des hommes. Une explication plausible est que les préoccupations concernant le harcélement et la sécurité dans les transports publics réduisent la volonté des femmes d’accepter des emplois qui\n\nimpliquent des trajets plus longs. Jeunes\n\nLes jeunes représentent une part importante de la population tunisienne en age de travailler. La population des jeunes devrait osciller autour de 21 % de la population totale et de 33 % de la population en Age de travailler (15-64 ans)\n\nau cours des deux prochaines décennies et diminuer\n\nAccés au marché du travail : coup de projecteur sur les femmes et les jeunes\n\nprogressivement par la suite.*’ La part des jeunes dans la population en Tunisie est légérement supérieure a la moyenne des pays de l'OCDE (19,1 % en 2020) et inférieure aux pays de la région (24,1 %) et aux groupes de revenus (23,7 %) de comparaison. Au cours des vingt prochaines années, les tendances démographiques atténueront quelque peu la pression exercée sur la création d’emplois par la part croissante des jeunes. Pourtant, ces tendances font de l’emploi des jeunes un défi extrémement pertinent, en particulier a la lumiére du vieillissement de la population. En 2040, environ 16 % de la population tunisienne sera Agée de 65 ans ou plus. Cette section donne un apercu de la situation des jeunes Tunisiens sur le marché du travail. Elle porte sur les principaux indicateurs du marché du travail et sur la difficulté de la transition entre l’école et le travail chez les diplomés universitaires, fournissant ainsi des preuves des principales contraintes a\n\nPemploi des jeunes. Les jeunes sont mal lotis sur le marché du travail par rapport aux personnes d’age mir. Premiérement, 4 29,2 pour cent, le ratio emploi/population chez les jeunes est inférieur de plus de 15 points de pourcentage au niveau observé chez les travailleurs d’age mar (30-54 ans). Cet écart important s’explique principalement par la faiblesse des taux d’emploi des jeunes de 15 a 24 ans, estimés 4 19,7 % en 2017 (Graphique 2.51 panel a). Ce phénoméne est en définitive imputable a l’augmentation des taux de fréquentation scolaire. Parmi les jeunes de 15 a 24 ans et de 25 a 29 ans, on estime que 46,5 % contre 5,5 %, respectivement, étaient scolarisés en 2019. A 44 % en 2017, Pécart du taux d’emploi entre les jeunes et les adultes est également considérable chez les jeunes de 25 4 29 ans. Le taux d’emploi a diminué chez les jeunes, alors qu’il a augmenté chez les travailleurs d’age mar et plus agés. Deuxiémement, les jeunes font piétre figure par rapport au reste de la population en age de travailler, y compris en matiére de chémage. Environ 1 jeune sur 3 agé de 15 a 29 ans était au chOmage en 2017. Cette part a atteint un pic de 38,2 % en 2011 et oscille depuis lors autour de 33 %. Les taux de ch6émage sont plus élevés dans les tranches d’ge plus jeunes. Il est estimé a 34,9 pour cent chez les jeunes de 15 a 24 ans et a 31,7 pour cent chez les jeunes de 25 a 29 ans (Graphique 2.51 panel b). Ce chiffre est 4 comparer aux 9,0 % des travailleurs d’4ge mfr et\n\naux 2,0 % des travailleurs plus agés. Troisitmement,\n\nWorld Population Prospects 2019 (database), Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations, New York, https://population.un.org/wpp/. a 70 %, le taux d’inactivité est élevé chez les jeunes de 15 a 24 ans en raison de la forte fréquentation scolaire.** Chez les jeunes de 25 a 29 ans, le taux d’inactivité est estimé a 35,5 pour cent (Graphique 2.51 panel c), contre 37,3 % et 66 % chez les travailleurs d’Age miir et les travailleurs\n\nAgés, respectivement. Les jeunes diplémés de l’enseignement supérieur, les jeunes femmes et les jeunes vivant dans les régions intérieures et les zones urbaines rencontrent davantage de difficultés pour accéder a l’emploi. Premiérement, le taux de ch6mage des jeunes femmes est plus élevé dans les deux tranches d’age, 15-24 et 25-29 ans, par rapport aux jeunes hommes. La disparité entre les hommes et les femmes passe de 3,4 a plus de 15,0 points de pourcentage a mesure que les femmes vieillissent (25-29 ans) (Tableau 2.4). Ensuite, le taux de chdmage des jeunes augmente avec le niveau de scolarité, passant de 16,2 % chez les jeunes de 25 a 29 ans n’ayant pas fait d’études 4 51,0 % chez les jeunes diplomés de l’enseignement supérieur de la méme tranche d’age. Les jeunes femmes de 25 a 29 ans titulaires d’un dipléme universitaire courent un risque de chémage encore plus grand que les jeunes hommes (57,5 % contre 40,3 %). De méme, le taux de chémage des jeunes de 15 a 24 ans était de 15,3 % s’ils n’avaient pas de certificat de scolarité, et ce taux passait a 32,4 % et 63,9 %, respectivement, s’ils avaient suivi un enseignement secondaire ou supérieur. Enfin, les jeunes vivant dans les régions les plus défavorisées du pays, a savoir le nord-ouest, le centre-ouest et le sud, sont confrontés a une probabilité de chémage plus élevée. Par exemple, parmi les jeunes de 25429 ans, le taux de chOmage a été estimé a 51,3 % dans la région du Sud-Ouest, 45,2 % dans la région du Sud-Est, 39,9 % dans la région du Nord-Ouest et 35,7 % dans la région du Centre-Ouest. Ces chiffres sont 4 comparer aux 20,9 et 22,5 % enregistrés respectivement dans les régions du Centre-Est et du Nord-Est. On constate également un écart important entre les jeunes des zones urbaines et ceux des zones rurales. Dans la tranche d’age des 25-29 ans, les jeunes urbains ont un taux de chémage de 33,4 %, contre 27,3 % pour les jeunes ruraux. Bien que les indicateurs se soient améliorés depuis la révolution de 2011, les jeunes diplémés de l’enseignement secondaire et supérieur, et en particulier les jeunes vivant dans les régions intérieures, ont été confrontés a des taux de chémage plus élevés en 2017 qu’en 2006 (voir annexe Graphique A 2.5). SL€cart important disparait aprés avoir pris en compte le grand nombre de jeunes scolarisés. En 2019, les taux d’inactivité calculés chez les jeunes de 15 4 24 ans non scolarisés étaient estimés 4 23 %. 94 Paysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nGRAPHIQUE 2.51.

Cependant, la majorité des jeunes chémeurs sont des femmes, ont suivi au mieux des études secondaires et vivent le long de la céte ou dans des zones urbaines. Un regard sur la distribution des jeunes chOmeurs par caractéristiques permet de clarifier le profil des groupes les plus importants. Outre l’incidence du chomage, cela refléte également le profil de la population jeune dans son ensemble (voir Tableau 2.4). Lincidence du chémage est plus importante chez les jeunes diplémés de l’enseignement supérieur (elle a doublé au cours de la derniére décennie) et chez les jeunes des régions intérieures. D’autres groupes représentent des parts plus importantes des jeunes chémeurs. Les jeunes diplomés de l’enseignement supérieur représentent environ 41 % duchémage total des jeunes : 24,2 pour cent chez les jeunes de 15 a 24 ans et 56,9 pour cent chez les jeunes de 25 429 ans. Les jeunes ayant un suivi au mieux des études secondaires représentent les 59 % restants. Les jeunes ayant suivi des études secondaires représentent 44,7 % (plus de 176 000 personnes) du chémage total des jeunes : 56,3 pour cent pour la tranche d’ge la plus jeune et 33,5 pour cent pour la tranche la plus agée. De méme, les jeunes des régions intérieures contribuent 4 environ\n\n43,7 % du chémage total des jeunes, alors que la plus grande part se situe dans le Grand Tunis : 30,2 pour cent, soit environ 120 000 personnes. Le deuxiéme groupe le plus important se trouve dans le centre-est (15,3 %). Le profil est similaire dans les deux tranches d’age. La prévalence des jeunes chémeurs urbains est en grande partie déterminée par la répartition géographique de la population des jeunes, bien que, parmi les jeunes de 25 4 29 ans, la concentration urbaine des jeunes chomeurs soit plus élevée (77 % des jeunes chémeurs urbains, contre 70 % de l’ensemble des jeunes urbains). Prés de 6 jeunes sur 10 sont au chémage depuis un an ou plus. Le taux de chémage de longue durée chez les jeunes est trop élevé. En 2015, on estimait que 58 % des jeunes de 15 a 29 ans faisaient partie des ch6meurs de longue durée, c’est-a-dire a la recherche d’un emploi depuis au moins 12 mois. Le taux est plus élevé chez les jeunes femmes (62,0 %) et chez les jeunes instruits : 64,0 % chez les jeunes diplémés de l’enseignement supérieur par rapport a 45,0 % chez les jeunes ayant achevé leur scolarité primaire.

        "On détecte une petite différence entre les quintiles des dépenses de consommation des ménages. En 2015, le taux de chomage de longue durée était estimé a 55 % et 56 % dans les deux quintiles inférieurs et a\n\nenviron 60 % dans les trois quintiles supérieurs. Le niveau d’études, la situation matrimoniale, la situation géographique et le revenu du ménage présentent de fortes corrélations avec la probabilité de chémage. Les tendances décrites ci-dessus sont corroborées par une analyse de régression a variables multiples estimée séparément par sexe parmi les jeunes qui participent ou non au marché du\n\ntravail, c’est-a-dire qui ont un emploi ou qui sont au chémage. Accés au marché du travail : coup de projecteur sur les femmes et les jeunes\n\nEn tenant compte d’un ensemble de caractéristiques des individus et des ménages, a savoir l’Age, le niveau d’études, la situation matrimoniale, la taille du ménage, le nombre d’enfants de 0 a 4 ans et de 5 a 14 ans dans le ménage, la région et la zone de résidence (milieu urbain ou rural), et le quintile de la distribution des dépenses du ménage, on obtient un sous-ensemble de caractéristiques significativement corrélées avec la probabilité de chOmage (Graphique 2.52 ; voir Graphique 2.55). La probabilité de chémage est plus élevée chez les dipl6més universitaires que chez les jeunes jamais scolarisés (+21,5 % chez les jeunes hommes et +31,9 % chez les jeunes femmes). Une fois que les jeunes sont actifs sur le marché du travail, c’est-a-dire qu’ils cherchent un emploi, ils sont moins susceptibles d’étre au chémage s’ils sont mariés. Ce lien est plus évident chez les jeunes hommes que chez les jeunes femmes (-16,9 %\n\ncontre -6,5 %, respectivement). De méme, le nombre\n\nd’enfants (de 0 a 4 ans et de 5 a 14 ans) dans le ménage est associé a la probabilité que les jeunes membres du ménage recherchent un emploi ou soient employés, en particulier les jeunes hommes. Le lieu de résidence a également un impact non négligeable. Les jeunes hommes et les jeunes femmes vivant prés du Grand Tunis sont moins susceptibles d’étre au ch6mage par rapport aux jeunes des autres régions. Les jeunes des ménages plus aisés sont plus susceptibles de chercher un emploi et, lorsqu’ils s’y mettent, ils ont plus de chances de trouver un emploi que les jeunes des ménages les plus pauvres. Statistiquement, effet marginal de vivre dans un ménage du deuxiéme ou du cinquiéme quintile, respectivement, par rapport a vivre dans un ménage du quintile inférieur de la distribution des dépenses passe de -10,2 pour cent 4 —26,8 pour cent chez les jeunes hommes et varie de —3,9 pour cent a -20,9 pour\n\ncent chez les jeunes femmes.

La part des jeunes faisant partie du groupe des NEET a oscillé autour de 40 % de la population agée de 15 4 29 ans au cours de la décennie, un taux supérieur a la moyenne de l’?OCDE (12,9 % en 2019) et a la moyenne des pays de la région et groupes de revenus de comparaison. Les taux de NEET différent considérablement selon les groupes de jeunes. Le taux de NEET chez les garcons et les jeunes hommes a atteint un pic pour les jeunes de 24 ans (44 %), puis a diminué a 35 % chez les 29 ans en 2015. Chez les jeunes femmes, le taux augmente avec l’ge et culmine 4 67 % a 28 ans (Graphique 2.53). En moyenne, le taux de NEET chez les jeunes femmes est estimé a 40 %, soit prés de 10 points de pourcentage de plus que chez les jeunes hommes (30,7 %). Chez les jeunes hommes, le chémage est la composante la plus importante du groupe des NEET, tandis que chez les jeunes femmes, la plus grande part des NEET est représentée par les jeunes femmes qui ne sont pas scolarisées et ne s’investissent pas sur le marché du travail. Les jeunes de 25 a 29 ans et ceux qui n’ont jamais été scolarisés (66,0 %) ou qui ont fait des études primaires (54,7 %) sont plus susceptibles de ne pas suivre d’études, de ne pas avoir d’emploi et de ne pas en chercher (Graphique 2.54 panels a, b, c). Les taux de NEET sont plus élevés chez les jeunes qui résident dans le Centre- Ouest (44,7 %), le Sud-Ouest (42,4 %) et le Sud-Est (38,9 %) (Graphique 2.54 panel d). Les taux de NEET sont plus élevés dans la partie inférieure de la distribution des dépenses des ménages. Les taux de NEET passent de 41,2 (63,4) % dans le quintile inférieur 4 15,6 (36) % dans le quintile supérieur chez les jeunes de 15 4 24 ans (25-29) (Graphique 2.54 panel e). Les jeunes vivant dans les régions cétiéres, les jeunes ayant suivi des études secondaires et les jeunes femmes représentent les parts les plus importantes de la population faisant partie du groupe des NEET. La prévalence des NEET parmi des groupes spécifiques de jeunes ne coincide pas avec les parts de la population faisant partie du groupe des NEET. Ce sont les femmes (56 %), les jeunes ayant suivi des études secondaires (52 %) et les jeunes des régions cotiéres (Grand Tunis, 20 % ; Nord-Est, 12,1 % ; et Centre-Est, 22 %) qui contribuent le plus a la faisant partie du groupe des NEET. Lge, la situation matrimoniale, le fait de résider en milieu urbain et les revenus du ménage présentent de fortes corrélations avec la probabilité de faire partie du groupe des\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nNEET. Les tendances décrites ci-dessus sont corroborées par une analyse de régression a variables multiples estimée séparément par sexe et par niveau de scolarité (jusqu’a lenseignement primaire vs l’enseignement secondaire ou supérieur). Lanalyse a tenu compte d’un ensemble de caractéristiques des individus et des ménages, a savoir ge, la situation matrimoniale, le nombre d’enfants de 0 a 4 ans et de 5 a 14 ans dans le ménage, le gouvernorat et la zone de résidence (milieu urbain ou rural) et le quintile de distribution des dépenses du ménage. Elle a permis de révéler que l’Age, la situation matrimoniale, le nombre d’enfants et la position dans la distribution des revenus étaient les corrélats les plus importants de la probabilité de faire partie du groupe des NEET, avec quelques distinctions selon le sexe et le niveau d’études (Graphique 2.55). Parmi les jeunes hommes ayant suivi des études secondaires ou supérieures, l’4ge est un corrélat important du statut de NEET. La probabilité de faire partie du groupe des NEET augmente de fagon monotone avec |’4ge jusqu’a environ 24 ans (+36 % par rapport a un jeune de 15 ans), puis commence a diminuer légérement. Le fait d’étre marié et de vivre dans un ménage avec des enfants de 5 4 14 ans réduit la probabilité de faire partie du groupe des NEET. Il en va de méme pour la zone de résidence dans un ménage plus aisé par rapport aux ménages les plus pauvres (premier quintile). En revanche, chez les jeunes hommes jamais scolarisés ou n’ayant pas suivi d’enseignement primaire, Page ne semble jouer aucun réle, alors que les effets négatifs de la situation matrimoniale, du nombre d’enfants et du quintile de revenu du ménage persistent. Dans le cas des jeunes femmes ayant suivi des études secondaires et supérieures, l’effet de age sur la probabilité de faire partie du groupe des NEET est positif et augmente jusqu’a environ 27 ans. Les effets marginaux sont également plus importants en ce qui concerne les jeunes hommes. Contrairement aux jeunes hommes, le fait d’étre marié et de vivre dans un ménage avec des enfants de 0 a 4 ans augmente les probabilités de faire partie du groupe des NEET, peut-étre en raison des responsabilités familiales que les femmes assument généralement lorsqu’elles se marient et ont des enfants. Le nombre d’enfants de 5 a 14 ans a un effet négatif sur la probabilité de faire partie du groupe des NEET. Le fait de résider en milieu urbain diminue les probabilités de faire partie du groupe des NEET chez les jeunes femmes diplémées de l’enseignement supérieur. De bonnes perspectives d’embauche et la présence de services de garde d’enfants de qualité peuvent constituer un facteur d’attraction vers le marché du travail.

Les jeunes hommes ayant un niveau d’études plus élevé mentionnent principalement le manque d’emplois, et cette part passe de 50,7 % chez les jeunes hommes ayant achevé leur scolarité primaire a plus de 78,0 % chez les jeunes hommes diplémés de l’enseignement supérieur (Graphique 2.56). Les taches ménagéres sont un facteur clé pour plus de 70 % des jeunes femmes en moyenne, avec des pointes a 80 % chez les jeunes femmes ayant achevé leur enseignement primaire ou secondaire. Le manque d’emplois ne semble étre une contrainte que pour les jeunes femmes diplémées de l’enseignement supérieur. La préférence déclarée de ne pas vouloir intégrer le marché du travail est rare chez les jeunes femmes, avec moins de 9 % ; les taux sont plus importants, avec environ 20 %, chez les jeunes femmes ayant un niveau d’études\n\nprimaire ou secondaire.*°\n\n“Les normes de identité de genre peuvent étre si bien intériorisées qu’elles font partie de la perception de soi, fagonnant ainsi les préférences. Les comportements et les choix peuvent étre affectés par des préoccupations relatives 4 l'image sociale et aux conséquences en termes de réputation dune déviation du comportement prescrit (Bertrand 2020). Vinactivité semble étre liée a l’exclusion dans I’esprit des jeunes hommes peu instruits. Parmi les jeunes hommes diplémés de l’enseignement supérieur, le manque d’emplois est la principale raison de l’inactivité. Parmi les jeunes femmes titulaires d’un dipléme universitaire, la raison est une combinaison du manque d’emplois et des rdles typiquement masculins et féminins. On peut déduire trois faits a partir des données obtenues par l’analyse de régression a variables multiples et par les raisons autodéclarées de Pinactivité et du souhait de ne pas rechercher un emploi. Tout d’abord, l’dge est déterminant chez les jeunes jeunes diplémés de l’enseignement supérieur. La probabilité de faire partie du groupe des NEET augmente avec le temps, probablement en raison de la transition plus longue entre l’école et le travail, due au manque de perspectives d’emplois, en particulier chez les diplémés universitaires. Deuxiémement, les responsabilités ménagéres agissent en sens inverse chez les jeunes hommes et les jeunes femmes, conformément 4 la division sexuelle des réles assignés par la société aux hommes et aux femmes.

Troisismement, la probabilité de faire partie du groupe des NEET n’est en aucun cas un privilége que seuls les jeunes de la classe moyenne et des classes aisées peuvent se permettre, mais plutét un probléme d’exclusion parmi les jeunes hommes peu instruits. Si elles sont mariées, les jeunes femmes ont une plus grande probabilité de faire partie du groupe des NEET, quelle que soit leur position dans la distribution des revenus. Les jeunes hommes, en revanche, intégrent le marché du travail pour subvenir aux besoins de leur famille nouvellement constituée. Les moteurs du chémage et de l’oisiveté des jeunes peuvent étre classés en trois groupes : la demande de travail, l’offre de travail et les facteurs institutionnels. Les données relatives aux deux premiers groupes de facteurs sont présentées ci-dessous. En ce qui concerne la composante institutionnelle, cette étude se limite 4 un apercu des politiques du marché du travail en vigueur, tandis que d’autres facteurs tels que les systémes d’assurance et d’assistance sociales, les lois de protection de l’emploi, les mécanismes de fixation des salaires et les salaires minimums ne sont pas examinés. La lenteur de la création d’emplois, en particulier dans les emplois 4 forte rémunération, est l’un des principaux moteurs du chémage et de l’inactivité chez les jeunes, notamment les dipl6més universitaires.*! Entre 2006 et 17,\n\n“1Outre la croissance économique, la présence d’un secteur public qui rémunére bien est souvent mentionnée comme l'une des causes possibles des taux de chémage élevés parmi les diplémés universitaires. Le chapitre 3 fournit des données sur les écarts de salaires entre les emplois du secteur privé et du secteur public chez les diplémés universitaires, ainsi que sur la situation sur le marché du travail et les caractéristiques des ménages des diplomés universitaires qui ne travaillent pas dans l’administration publique. Vemploi total a augmenté a un taux annualisé moyen de 1,4 %, tandis que la population active a augmenté de 1,7 % par an (Graphique 2.57). Les jeunes de 25 4 29 ans ont été les plus touchés par la lenteur de la création d’emplois. En moyenne, leur emploi total a diminué de -0,3 pour cent par an (-13 100 au total), tandis que le nombre de ces jeunes dans la population active a augmenté a un taux annualisé d’environ 1 pour cent (68 500 au total). Le nombre de jeunes de 15 a 24 ans faisant partie de la population active a diminué, tout comme le nombre de ces jeunes ayant un emploi, grace a des taux de scolarisation plus élevés et a une plus longue durée de la fréquentation scolaire. En revanche, chez les personnes Agées, l’économie a généré des emplois a un rythme moyen plus rapide que le taux d’expansion de la population active. Bien que le taux de création d’emplois se soit accéléré aprés la révolution, il n’a pas été suffisant pour absorber le grand nombre de diplémés universitaires. Lemploi ayant augmenté denviron 53 000 postes par an en moyenne, prés de 65 000 jeunes supplémentaires ont obtenu un dipléme, en moyenne, entre l’année universitaire 2012/13 et l’année universitaire 2017/18 (Graphique 2.58). Si l’on considére la composition professionnelle de l’emploi, le déficit est frappant. Entre 2011 et 2017, le nombre d’emplois a forte rémunération, y compris ceux des cadres, des spécialistes, des techniciens et assimilés, que les dipl6més universitaires peuvent aspirer a obtenir, a augmenté de moins de 11 000 par\n\nan (environ 64 000 au total). Du cété de l’offre, la qualité de l’apprentissage peut limiter la capacité des diplomés universitaires 4 trouver un emploi.

La qualité de Papprentissage en Tunisie est inférieure a celle des pays de comparaison, par exemple en ce qui concerne les résultats aux tests mathématiques et dans les matiéres scientifiques (voir Graphique 2.7 Graphique 2.8). Les diplémés universitaires ont tendance a choisir des filieres qui ne correspondent pas a la demande du secteur privé. Il existe un écart important entre les compétences requises par le marché du travail et la demande des étudiants en matiére d’enseignement supérieur. Environ 35,0 % des employeurs en Tunisie citent la main-d’ceuvre insuffisamment instruite comme une contrainte majeure\n\nau bon fonctionnement et a la croissance des entreprises. Cette part avait augmenté par rapport aux 29,1 % de 2013 et est supérieure a la moyenne des économies de la région MENA (20,4 %).* Les filiéres d’études choisies par les dipl6més universitaires ne correspondent pas aux besoins du marché du travail. Environ 4 diplémés universitaires sur 10 ont obtenu un dipléme en sciences humaines ou sociales, y compris en commerce et en droit, au cours de Pannée universitaire 2017/18 (Graphique 2.59). Alors que le nombre de diplémés en sciences humaines a diminué, passant de plus de 11 500 en 2012/13 a environ 7 800 en 2017/18, le nombre de diplémés en sciences sociales a augmenté d’environ 1 000 au cours de la période (environ\n\n“Données 2020 des sur les entreprises (tableau de bord), Banque mondiale, Washington, DC, https:/Awww.enterprisesurveys.org/.

Une proportion plus faible était scolarisée et a obtenu un dipléme dans les matiéres scientifiques, les technologies, l’ingénierie et les mathématiques, y compris dans les domaines des statistiques, de la construction et des TIC.

Les dipl6més en sciences sociales et en droit ont plus de mal a trouver un emploi étant donné la diminution du nombre de techniciens et assimilés employés dans ces domaines. augmentation du nombre d’emplois salariés chez les professionnels dans les domaines des sciences, de l’ingénierie et de la santé a été limitée. Les diplomés en sciences humaines peuvent raisonnablement s’attendre a trouver des emplois étant donné l’expansion continue de l’embauche dans le secteur public dans ce domaine. Toutefois, la hausse des embauches dans le secteur public n’est pas durable, et les\n\nembauches ont récemment diminué. Cela contribue a allonger la transition entre l’école et le travail, et de nombreux jeunes, en particulier les jeunes femmes, décrochent. D’abord, a l’Age de 21 ans, 50 % des jeunes tunisiens de 15 a 29 ans quittent l’école. Ce résultat est similaire a celui observé dans les économies avancées, et supérieur a |’4ge moyen dans les pays a revenu intermédiaire (OCDE 2015). Ensuite, peu de jeunes tunisiens combinent travail et études, moins de 1 % selon les données de l’enquéte sur le budget des ménages de 2015. Cela peut contribuer a une transition moins harmonieuse entre l’école et le travail et étre positivement corrélé avec une part plus importante de jeunes faisant partie du groupe\n\ndes NEET et un allongement de la transition (Manacorda\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nGRAPHIQUE 2.61.

Troisitmement, la Tunisie se distingue par des temps de transitions nettement plus longs entre |’école et le premier emploi, avec une moyenne de 35 mois et une meédiane de 29 mois, ce qui n’est inférieur qu’a la Jordanie et a la Cisjordanie et Gaza) (Graphique 2.61 panel a). Les transitions sont particuliérement longues chez les femmes (une médiane de 41,6 mois contre 21,2 mois chez les hommes). Quatriémement, on s’attend a ce qu’une grande partie des jeunes ne parviennent jamais a trouver un premier emploi : 23 pour cent en moyenne en Tunisie contre 17 pour cent au Moyen-Orient et en Afrique du Nord ; cette part est disproportionnellement plus importante chez les femmes (35 pour cent contre 12 pour cent chez les hommes) (Graphique 2.61 panel b). Ces données sont particuliérement inquiétantes, car la probabilité de trouver un emploi chez les jeunes diminue 4 mesure que la durée de la transition augmente, tant dans les pays en développement que dans les pays avancés. Ce phénoméne est connu sous le nom d’effet négatif de la dépendance sur la durée. La division sexuelle des réles assignés par la société aux hommes et aux femmes limite la participation des jeunes femmes au marché du travail aprés le mariage. Des études récentes menées par |’équipe des sciences comportementales de la Banque mondiale montrent que les hommes et les femmes ont une opinion favorable de la participation des hommes aux taches ménagéres, ce qui suggére que ces disparités dans la répartition du temps\n\nsont déterminées par les coutumes et les traditions. b.

Les examens indiquent que la grande majorité des politiques du marché du travail en vigueur du gouvernement ciblent les diplémés universitaires (Boughzala 2019). En 2018, quatre politiques ont représenté la plus grande composante des politiques du marché du travail en vigueur\n\n(voir annexe Tableau A 2.4). e Le Stage d’initiation a la vie professionnelle a été introduit en 1987. Ila été rebaptisé “Contrat d’initiation a la vie professionnelle”. Il vise a faciliter ’accés a Pemploi en aidant les jeunes 4 acquérir une expérience professionnelle. Il offre aux diplémés universitaires une couverture sociale, ainsi qu’une allocation minimale de 300 TD par mois, dont 50 % sont payés par le gouvernement et 50 % par les entreprises participantes qui s’engagent 4 embaucher au moins 50 % des jeunes qu’elles ont soutenus dans le cadre du programme. ¢ Le contrat d’adaptation et d’insertion professionnelle est analogue du contrat d’insertion dans la vie professionnelle pour les jeunes non-diplémés. Les jeunes ciblés recoivent une allocation plus faible et ne peuvent participer plus d’une fois au programme, contrairement au cas du contrat d’insertion dans la vie professionnelle. ¢ Le Service civil volontaire a été introduit en 2010 pour répondre aux besoins particuliers des régions intérieures,\n\nAccés au marché du travail : coup de projecteur sur les femmes et les jeunes\n\nqui sont moins urbanisées et comptent relativement moins d’entreprises formelles. ¢ Le Programme d’accompagnement des promoteurs des petites entreprises promeut entrepreneuriat chez les jeunes. Les participants peuvent bénéficier d’une formation gratuite, de services d’orientation et d’accompagnement, et d’un financement. Agence Nationale pour |’Emploi et le Travail Indépendant (ANETI) et la Banque Tunisienne de Solidarité participent au programme. Ce dernier est le principal pourvoyeur de financement. Le programme est relativement petit par rapport aux autres. Il couvre moins\n\nde 4 000 jeunes par an. Les subventions salariales offrent des possibilités d’emploi temporaire aux bénéficiaires et de la main-d’ceuvre aux entreprises 4 moindre coat, souvent au prix d’importants effets d’aubaine et de substitution. Vobjectif des subventions salariales est de stimuler la demande de main-d’ceuvre en subventionnant les cofits connexes pour les entreprises. Cela peut permettre d’aider les jeunes travailleurs, dont la productivité peut étre faible au départ. Comme le coat de l’embauche est réduit, les employeurs peuvent étre plus enclins a employer les groupes cibles. En Tunisie, étant donné Poffre abondante de dipl6més universitaires, le prix relatif de leur travail devrait étre ajusté a la baisse. Cependant, existence de conventions salariales collectives limite le potentiel de tels ajustements, ce qui incite 4 embaucher les jeunes de maniére informelle. Les subventions salariales peuvent jouer un réle en rendant l’emploi formel des jeunes plus attrayant pour les employeurs. Les subventions salariales prennent plusieurs formes selon la maniére dont elles sont fixées (par exemple, une réduction des cotisations de sécurité sociale ou le versement d’une fraction du salaire), qui les recoit (travailleurs ou employeurs), qui est éligible (tous les travailleurs, les nouveaux embauchés, les personnes a la recherche d’un premier emploi, etc.) et le type de conditionnalités imposées aux employeurs (Angel- Ardinola, Nucifora et Robalino 2015). Des évaluations récentes indiquent qu’en général, les subventions salariales sont un outil efficace pour augmenter les taux d’emploi parmi les personnes éligibles, mais surtout comme moyen de fournir une expérience professionnelle 4 court terme plutét qu’a un emploi permanent, en particulier parmi les chémeurs de longue durée (Card, Kluve et Weber 2018, McKenzie 2017). En outre, les subventions salariales semblent réussir 4 apporter un soutien aux entreprises et a les empécher de licencier en cas de chocs temporaires. Les subventions salariales posent deux problémes majeurs : les effets d’aubaine, c’est-a-dire le risque de subventionner\n\ndes emplois qui auraient été créés de toute facon, et des\n\neffets de substitution, autrement dit l’éventualité que les employeurs remplacent les travailleurs non subventionnés par des travailleurs subventionnés. Les évaluations réalisées en Europe indiquent que les effets d’aubaine et de substitution peuvent affecter environ 90 % des emplois (Martin 2000). Le degré de ciblage, la mesure dans laquelle les subventions affectent les nouvelles embauches, le fait qu’elles soient uniques ou qu’elles fassent partie d’un ensemble, et l’existence d’un suivi et d’une évaluation efficaces sont des éléments cruciaux pour assurer le succés des subventions salariales. En Tunisie, les nombreuses subventions salariales intro- duites au cours des derniéres décennies ont aidé les jeunes a décrocher un premier emploi et a acquérir une expérience professionnelle. Cela a pu contribuer a atténuer Paugmentation du taux de chémage des jeunes, qui aurait pu étre plus élevé sans ces subventions salariales qui leur sont destinées. Les difficultés rencontrées pour définir et faire respecter le ciblage, l’affectation des stagiaires aux taches pertinentes au sein des entreprises et l’application des conditionnalités visant a retenir les stagiaires et les travailleurs a issue de la subvention jettent un doute sur Pefficacité des subventions salariales. Une évaluation du programme Contrat d’insertion dans la vie professionnelle, basée sur une étude de suivi des diplomés auprés d’un échantillon de 4 700 jeunes ayant obtenu leur diplome en 2004 et interrogés en 2005 et 2007, permet de constater que le programme a réduit le taux de chOmage des diplémés universitaires de 8 points de pourcentage, en supposant Pabsence d’effets d’aubaine ou de substitution, avec un coat unitaire estimé a environ 18 000 DT (Broecke 2013). Cependant, la participation au programme sur une base volontaire, les subventions attribuées selon le principe du premier arrivé, premier servi, et absence de combinaison avec d’autres services, tels que la formation, le conseil et Paide a la recherche d’emploi, soulévent des questions quant a l’efficacité du programme a moyen terme (Broecke 2013). A avenir, il est essentiel que le programme cible les diplémés présentant le risque de chdmage le plus élevé, que les critéres d’éligibilité soient respectés avec précision et qu’un suivi adéquat des conditionnalités soit mis en ceuvre, ainsi que des évaluations ex post en ayant recours a des données administratives. Des subventions salariales bien congues, suivies et évaluées pour l’emploi dans le secteur privé peuvent financer l’emploi temporaire des jeunes et leur permettre d’acquérir une expérience professionnelle, jouant ainsi le rdle de tremplin vers un emploi plus permanent. Cela peut également contribuer\n\na contenir les effets négatifs liés aux effets d’aubaine et\n\n107\n\n108\n\nde substitution et 4 atténuer le coat fiscal du recrutement\n\ndans le secteur public. De maniére générale, les politiques du marché du travail en vigueur ont des effets positifs modestes, en tout cas plus modestes que ceux auxquels s’attendent généralement les bénéficiaires et les décideurs politiques. Les politiques du marché du travail en vigueur sont un instrument que les gouvernements ont adopté depuis longtemps pour intervenir sur le marché du travail dans le but de générer des possibilités d’emploi plus nombreuses et de meilleure qualité pour les travailleurs, souvent des travailleurs ayant accés a peu d’autres perspectives. Outre les subventions salariales et les travaux publics qui partagent le méme objectif, ces politiques agissent généralement sur l’offre de main- d’ceuvre en augmentant l’employabilité des travailleurs (programmes de formation, y compris la formation commerciale pour favoriser le travail indépendant), et sur l’adéquation entre la demande et l’offre de main- d’ceuvre par le biais de programmes d’aide a la recherche d’emploi et de jumelage emploi-travailleur. Un examen des évaluations récentes des politiques du marché du travail en vigueur dans les pays en développement révéle que la formation professionnelle, les subventions salariales et les programmes d’aide a la recherche d’emploi ont des effets modestes dans la plupart des cas (McKenzie 2017). En revanche, les attentes des participants et des responsables politiques quant a l’impact de ces programmes sont généralement trop optimistes. Si les faibles effets de la plupart des programmes peuvent étre attribués au fait que les marchés du travail fonctionnent finalement relativement bien, notamment dans les zones urbaines, il est également possible que d’autres contraintes limitent la création d’emplois (McKenzie 2017). Si tel est le cas, les politiques non traditionnelles en vigueur quant au marché du travail qui s’attaquent, par exemple, aux inadéquations\n\ndans les secteurs et les emplacements géographiques selon\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHIE DU CHAPITRE 2\n\nAlesina, Alberto Francesco, Paola Giuliano et Nathan Nunn."

Encourager l’enseignement et la formation techniques et professionnels (EFTP) peut étre une voie prometteuse pour stimuler ’emploi des jeunes a long terme. Etant donné que la création d’emplois a forte rémunération a été faible et que le nombre de diplémés universitaires est bien supérieur a la capacité de l’économie, l’EFTP pourrait étre une solution viable pour stimuler la croissance de l’emploi en Tunisie. Le nombre de diplémés de l’EFTP est considérablement inférieur au nombre de diplémés universitaires. En 2017, environ 27 500 personnes ont obtenu un dipléme de PEFTP, et plus du double (56 279) un dipléme universitaire, méme si les effectifs sont assez similaires (52 075 inscrits dans les institutions publiques d’EFTP et 57 503 dans les universités).** Selon la Banque mondiale (2020a), ’ EFTP est pergu comme une option peu attrayante compte tenu du faible statut des colléges techniques au niveau de lenseignement secondaire inférieur et du manque d’alternatives de qualité au niveau de l’enseignement secondaire supérieur (OCDE 2015). Dans le méme temps, une étude menée par |’Observatoire national de l’emploi et des compétences (ONEQ 2017) révéle que, quatre ans aprés l’obtention de leur dipléme, environ 65 % des diplomés de PEFTP étaient employés, avec toutefois un écart entre les hommes et les femmes qui favorise les hommes puisque seuls 20 % des hommes diplémés actifs étaient a la recherche d’un emploi, contre 41 % des femmes diplomées. En outre, l’étude révéle que les diplomés de PEFTP dans les domaines des arts, de la mécanique, de la construction, des transports, de l’électricité, de la péche et de Paquaculture avaient plus de chances de trouver un emploi. “Pour les diplémés de l’EFTP, voir ONEQ (2019) ; les informations sur les diplomés universitaires sont tirées des données du ministére de Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche scientifique.

La plupart des inactifs sont de jeunes femmes mariées vivant dans des ménages aisés, tandis que la majorité des ch6meurs sont de jeunes hommes vivant chez leurs parents. ™ Les avantages non monétaires et la sécurité de l'emploi offerts par les emplois du secteur public peuvent contribuer aux taux élevés de périodes sans emploi (ch6mage et inactivité) observés chez les diplémés universitaires. ® La division sexuelle des rdles assignés par la société est renforcée par un écart de rémunération entre hommes et femmes considérable dans le secteur privé. Les femmes sont payées, en moyenne, 0,82 dollar pour chaque dollar versé aux hommes par heure travaillée, et la plupart des écarts de rémunération sont attribuables a une structure salariale différente ou a des caractéristiques non observées qui rendraient, en moyenne, les hommes plus productifs que les femmes. ®™ Dans le secteur public, en revanche, les femmes gagnent, en moyenne, environ un tiers de plus que les hommes par heure travaillée, et une grande partie de la prime salariale est attribuable aux caractéristiques plus productives des femmes. = Les retombées économiques de |’éducation sont considérables : l’enseignement supérieur engendre une prime d’environ 26 % par heure travaillée par rapport a un enseignement secondaire chez les travailleurs salariés. ny = Les retombées économiques de l’enseignement supérieur dans le secteur privé ont commencé a —e\n\ndiminuer parce que la demande de travailleurs instruits a été faible. En revanche, les retombées économiques de |’enseignement supérieur sont considérablement plus élevées et en augmentation\n\ndans le secteur public. 124\n\ne chapitre 2 propose une vue d’ensemble des\n\ntendances démographiques et montre que sur le\n\nplan démographique, la fenétre de tir est réduit, mais atteignable, et que la qualité de l’apprentissage accuse toujours en retard par rapport aux pays de comparaison, malgré des progrés significatifs en matiére de scolarisation. Le chapitre décrit les tendances récentes des indicateurs du marché du travail et souligne la sous-exploitation du capital humain ; seuls 50 % des Tunisiens en Age de travailler participent au marché du travail. Il se concentre sur deux groupes qui rencontrent des difficultés particuliéres pour accéder au marché du travail, 4 savoir les femmes et les jeunes. Il documente les modestes améliorations enregistrées au cours de la derniére décennie, qui sont principalement attribuables aux jeunes cohortes de femmes et aux progrés réalisés en matiére de niveaux d’études de la population en age de travailler. La faiblesse de la demande de main-d’ceuvre, les comportements traditionnels et linsuffisance des services de garde d’enfants sont autant d’obstacles a l’intégration des femmes sur le marché du travail. Environ 4 jeunes de 15 a 29 ans sur 10 font partie du groupe des NEET, et 1 jeune sur 3 est au chémage. Alors que les taux d’inactivité sont plus élevés chez les jeunes hommes et femmes peu instruits et semblent étre attribuables a l’exclusion, les taux de chmage sont élevés chez les diplémés universitaires et semblent étre en grande partie attribuables a la lenteur de la création d’emplois.

Niveau d’emploi et de rémunération\n\nLes embauches dans le secteur public ont augmenté a la suite de la révolution de 2011 et, avec les augmentations de salaires, elles absorbent une grande partie des recettes fiscales. Pour répondre au défi de l’insécurité et des revendications\n\nsociales qui ont suivi la révolution de 2011, les embauches\n\ndans le secteur public ont considérablement augmenté avec la loi de 2012 favorisant l’accés 4 l’administration publique des personnes blessées pendant la révolution et couvertes par l’amnistie de 2011 (Brockmeyer, Khatrouch et Raballand 2015 ; INS 2017 ; OCDE 2018) (encadré 3.1). ENCADRE 3.1. Service civil : Mécanismes d’embauche et de rémunération\n\nLe secteur public en Tunisie comprend les administrations centrales et régionales, les autorités locales et les sociétés publiques. Les employés du secteur public sont régis par l'un des sept régimes d'emploi suivants : le régime général des employés publics des institutions centrales et locales de I’Etat a caractére administratif (le Statut général de la fonction publique) et six régimes distincts pour les magistrats, les membres du tribunal administratif, les membres de la Cour des comptes, les forces de sécurité intérieure, les militaires et les agents des douanes (Brockmeyer, Khatrouch et Raballand 2015). En outre, un régime distinct régit l'emploi dans les sociétés publiques. La fonction publique générale comprend les employés publics des institutions centrales et locales de I’Etat 4 vocation administrative. Elle couvre la plupart des employés de la fonction publique. Les fonctionnaires sont répartis en fonctionnaires,\n\nouvriers et personnel temporaire. Procédures d’embauche\n\nLes sept régimes sont di s en environ 130 groupes ou corps professionnels (par exemple, enseignants, inspecteurs des finances, ingénieurs, etc.) Dans chaque groupe, les employés sont classés en fonction de leur niveau de scolarité et sont recrutés dans l'une des quatre catégories suivantes : A, B, C ou D. La catégorie A est la plus élevée et comprend trois sous-catégories (A1, A2, A3). La catégorie A requiert au moins un certain niveau d'études universitaires (catégorie A1, une maitrise ; catégorie A2, une licence ; et catégorie A3, deux années d'études universitaires). La catégorie B requiert un dipléme d'études secondaires. La catégorie C requiert un certain niveau d'études secondaires (quatre ans aprés I’école primaire). La catégorie D requiert un enseignement primaire. Les ouvriers sont classés dans des unités allant de 1 4 3 en fonction de leur niveau de scolarité. Le systeme se fonde sur I’ancienneté de carriére. Un employé est recruté a un grade spécifique qui correspond a sa formation. Le travailleur recoit des augmentations de salaire basées sur l’ancienneté et est titularisé dans un court délai (Boutar 2018). Les fonctionnaires sont recrutés par le biais de procédures de recrutement par concours qui se fondent sur des tests ou sur les antécédents (sélection sur dossier). Les détails de chaque procédure sont déterminés par le statut spécifique et les critéres d’éligibilité et incluent généralement le dipléme exact requis plutdt que le niveau d’études minimum. Environ la moitié des postes des catégories A, B et C sont pourvus par recrutement externe, et l'autre moitié par promotion interne. Le nombre de postes est négocié entre chaque ministére et le ministére des Finances sur la base du budget annuel affecté.> Les ouvriers sont recrutés en utilisant une version simplifigée du systéme de recrutement des fonctionnaires. Les travailleurs sont embauchés a des postes permanents par le biais de tests ou d’examens professionnels. Les travailleurs temporaires sont recrutés par nomination directe sur une base révocable pour une période déterminée, soit pour occuper un poste a pourvoir da a un manque de personnel permanent, soit pour remplacer un membre du personnel. Les travailleurs contractuels sont recrutés par contrat pour effectuer des projets spécifiques pendant une période déterminée. Llamnistie générale de 2011 et plusieurs dispositions exceptionnelles en 2012 ont été approuvées pour permettre le recrutement direct, en plus de la régularisation des travailleurs contractuels et temporaires en 2012 et 2013 (Brockmeyer, Khatrouch, et Raballand 2015). Ces dispositions ont entrainé une augmentation sensible du recrutement, qui a plus que doublé entre 2010 et 2011 et s’est maintenu a un niveau élevé jusqu’en 2013 (Graphique B 3.1.1). Promotions\n\nLes fonctionnaires peuvent obtenir une promotion de trois maniéres (Boutar 2018). La premiére consiste a réussir un cycle de formation continue. La seconde consiste en une procédure de recrutement par concours interne ; seuls les employés ayant cing ans d’ancienneté dans leur grade actuel sont éligibles a cette catégorie de promotion. Le troisigme repose sur un systeme de points et est utilisé pour 10 % des fonctionnaires ayant un minimum de 10 ans d’ancienneté dans leur grade actuel ; il s‘agit d’une option de promotion de dernier recours qui n’est proposée qu'une seule fois dans la carriére d’un employé. Evaluation\n\nLes fonctionnaires sont évalués selon un double systéme de notation qui comprend une note professionnelle annuelle et une note de performance trimestrielle ligée 4 une prime versée, en plus du salaire (Brockmeyer, Khatrouch et Raballand 2015). La note professionnelle est la somme de 5 notes sur 20 pour les critéres suivants : qualité du travail, quantité de travail, relations interpersonnelles et comportement, assiduité et persévérance.

        "cette évaluation. La notation professionnelle n’est généralement ni transparente ni objective, car il n’existe pas de buts ou d’objectifs sur lesquels la notation pourrait se fonder, et aucun critére d’évaluation de la quantité et de la qualité du travail n’est fixé. En outre, la majorité des fonctionnaires obtiennent des notes comprises entre 95 et 100, ce qui rend impossible la distinction entre les employés dont le rendement est faible ou élevé. De méme, dans le cadre de |’évaluation de la prime de rendement, la plupart des employés recoivent la note la plus élevée possible, sauf s‘ils ont été absents, sont arrivés en retard au travail ou ont pris un congé de maladie. La prime de rendement est considérée comme une rémunération fixe supplémentaire parce que les superviseurs ne veulent pas risquer de traiter des requétes, de subir des griefs et des conflits internes en différenciant les grades. La politique de rémunération a donc été révisée pour inclure une part de deux tiers de la prime de performance en tant que partie fixe des salaires mensuels d’un certain nombre de groupes professionnels. Les superviseurs ont également la possibilité de sanctionner les employés dont le rendement est faible. Les sanctions du premier degré comprennent le blame et la réprimande. Les sanctions du second degré, qui doivent étre prononcées par une commission disciplinaire, comprennent un retard d’un an dans |’avancement, une suspension temporaire, un transfert avec changement de lieu de résidence ou un licenciement. Brockmeyer, Khatrouch et Raballand (2015) montrent que, outre l'avertissement et la réprimande, les sanctions de second degré sont rares. Rémunération et avantages\n\nLa rémunération des fonctionnaires comprend un salaire de base et un certain nombre d’indemnités, comprenant des indemnités classiques, des indemnités propres a un corps professionnel et des indemnités spéciales, en plus d’une prime de rendement trimestrielle. Les employés occupant des postes de direction regoivent des indemnités de direction. La prime de rendement représente une petite fraction de la rémunération totale et n'est affectée que par l’assiduité et non par la qualité du travail. Chaque corps professionnel dispose d'une grille salariale, composée de deux types d’augmentation du salaire de base : une augmentation basée sur l’ancienneté et une augmentation basée sur la promotion. L'augmentation basée sur l'ancienneté est automatique, et le taux et la fréquence d’augmentation sont déterminés par la loi. En général, il y a une augmentation chaque année pendant les quatre premiéres années et tous les deux ans par la suite. Les indemnités spécifiques par groupe professionnel sont vastes et compliquent la réaffectation du personnel entre les groupes professionnels ou les ministéres, car cela pourrait impliquer une perte monétaire importante pour l’employé. Une promotion s’accompagne d’une augmentation en fonction de la nature de la promotion, mais le niveau d’ancienneté est remis au premier seuil. Les fonctionnaires ont droit a un large éventail de congés annuels, notamment le congé administratif, le congé pour raisons de santé, le congé de formation, le congé sans solde et le congé pour création d’entreprise. En outre, les femmes bénéficient d'un congé de maternité de deux mois a plein salaire et peuvent bénéficier d’un congé postnatal 4 demi-salaire d’une durée maximale de quatre mois. Les femmes ayant des enfants a charge de moins de 16 ans peuvent demander un régime spécial de travail 4 temps partiel 4 deux tiers du salaire a temps plein. La durée du régime est fixée a trois ans tant que les conditions sont remplies et peut étre renouvelée deux fois au cours de la carriére administrative de l'agent et dans les mémes conditions. Les fonctionnaires bénéficiant du régime spécial de travail 4a temps partiel conservent tous leurs droits en matiére d’avancement, de promotion, de congés et de sécurité sociale. Les fonctionnaires bénéficient également d’horaires flexibles, jusqu’a une demi- heure avant ou aprés I’heure de prise de fonctions, et les employés ayant un ou plusieurs enfants a charge de moins de 16 ans bénéficient d’une flexibilité allant jusqu’a une heure et demie, sous réserve d'une compensation le jour méme. Les données de |’Enquéte Nationale sur |'Emploi de 2019 confirment que les travailleurs du secteur public bénéficient d’avantages non monétaires auxquels la plupart des travailleurs du secteur privé n’ont pas accés. Prés de 88 % des travailleurs du secteur public ont un contrat a durée indéterminée, contre 61 % des salariés du secteur formel et 22 % des travailleurs du secteur informel. Parmi ces derniers, prés d’un sur deux (45,6 %) n‘avait pas de contrat. De méme, pratiquement tous les travailleurs du secteur public avaient un emploi régulier permanent en 2019, contre environ 87,0 % des travailleurs salariés formels et 55,0 % des travailleurs salariés informels. Parmi ces derniers, environ 4 travailleurs sur 10 avaient un emploi temporaire ou occasionnel, et environ 5 % avaient un emploi saisonnier. (suite)\n\nNiveau d’emploi et de rémunération\n\nENCADRE 3.1. Service civil : Mécanismes d’embauche et de rémunération (suite)\n\nPar rapport au secteur privé, la fonction publique est un employeur plus favorable aux femmes. En 2017, la part des femmes dans le secteur privé était d’environ 24 %, contre 36 % dans la fonction publique. Bien que la part globale des femmes dans la fonction publique ait diminué d’environ 3,5 points de pourcentage entre 2011 et 2017, leur part dans les trois premiéres catégories (A1, A2 et A3) est restée constante ou a augmenteé (a environ 50 %) en 2017. Au sein du groupe des fonctionnaires, les femmes étaient en grande partie employées dans les deux catégories supérieures (A1 et A2) en 2017 ; prés de 75 % des femmes appartenaient a la catégorie A1 et A2, contre environ 53 % des hommes (Graphique B 3.1.2).

Le recrutement direct n'est autorisé que pour les étudiants des écoles agréées, telles que I'Ecole nationale d’administration. En 2012, le nombre de fonctionnaires a augmenté de plus de 88 000 (prés de 20 %) par rapport 4 2011 et, entre 2011 et 2017, son nombre a augmenté de prés de 200 000 (45 % sur l’ensemble de la période et une moyenne de 1,9 % par an) (INS 2017, 2019). augmentation du nombre de fonctionnaires, conjuguée aux hausses de salaires, a entrainé une croissance de la masse salariale, qui est passée denviron 11,9 % du produit intérieur brut (PIB) en 2011 a 14,6 % en 2019 et A 17,6 % en 2020 selon les estimations. Selon le Fonds monétaire international (FMI 2021), la majeure partie de l’élargissement de la masse salariale est imputable aux augmentations de salaires, y compris les augmentations de salaires entre 2016 et 2018, une augmentation supplémentaire des salaires convenue en 2019 et livrée en trois tranches sur la période 2019-20 pour un total de 1,5 % du PIB, et un pic supplémentaire équivalent a 0,3 % du PIB convenu en 2020. Cette masse salariale pléthorique exclut d’autres dépenses publiques. En 2020, elle a consommé environ 75 % des recettes fiscales, et elle représentait prés de trois fois ’'ampleur des investissements publics et prés de six fois le montant des dépenses publiques\n\nconsacrées aux programmes sociaux (FMI 2021). Environ 44 % des personnes employées occupent des emplois informels. En 2019, prés de 2,8 millions de travailleurs étaient employés dans le secteur privé et, parmi eux, environ 1,6 million étaient des travailleurs informels (voir Graphique 3.1). En 2019, le taux d’informalité était estimé a 43,9 % dans l’ensemble et a 55,7 % chez les travailleurs du secteur privé. A 87,7 %, le taux est considérablement plus élevé chez les travailleurs non salariés que chez les travailleurs salariés (29,0 %). En 2019, 1 travailleur informel sur 2 était un salarié (49 %), suivi des travailleurs a leur compte (33 %), des employeurs (11 %) et des travailleurs familiaux non\n\nrémunérés (6 %) (voir Graphique 3.1). Les groupes vulnérables sont plus exposés a l’informalité et ont moins de chances d’étre employés dans le secteur public ou dans des emplois formels du secteur privé.

Remarque : Les statistiques sont basées sur les données du deuxiéme trimestre de |'Enquéte Nationale sur |/Emploi (ENPE) 2019. Les statistiques par décile de la consommation des ménages par habitant se basent sur I'Enquéte sur le Budget des Ménages (EBM) 2015 et renvoient a la population active agée de 18 ans et plus, en raison d’une question que les répondants pouvaient sauter selon leur Age dans la question sur affiliation a la sécurité sociale. présentés pour le secteur public, les travailleurs salariés formels et informels, et les travailleurs non salariés formels et informels, y compris les employeurs, les travailleurs a\n\nleur compte et les travailleurs familiaux non rémunérés. ¢ Sexe. Dans la distribution globale de la population active par sexe (26,4 % de femmes), une plus grande partie des femmes sont employées dans le secteur public (32,4 %) et dans le secteur privé formel (33,6 %). Ce chiffre est 4 comparer aux 23,0 % des travailleurs salariés informels et aux parts encore plus faibles des travailleurs non salariés formels et informels (17,7 % et 15,7 %, respectivement). Parmi les travailleurs non salariés, la disparité entre les hommes et les femmes est considérablement plus faible en ce qui concerne le statut formel et s’explique davantage par la part plus faible de femmes a la téte de leur propre entreprise plutét que de travailler pour un salaire. e Age. Les jeunes de 15 4 24 ans sont plus susceptibles de travailler de maniére informelle contre salaire par rapport aux travailleurs d’age mfr, mais moins susceptibles d’étre des travailleurs non salariés formels ou informels. La part des jeunes parmi les salariés du secteur public est inférieure a celle des autres tranches d’age, sauf pour les travailleurs de 65 ans ou plus qui, a cet Age, sont retraités de la fonction publique. Les travailleurs de 65 ans et plus viennent gonfler\n\nles emplois non salariés, et plutét dans les emplois\n\nde l’informel, que dans les emplois salariés. Environ 6,0 % et 6,8 % des travailleurs non salariés formels et informels, respectivement, ont 65 ans ou plus, contre environ 1 % des travailleurs salariés (0,8 % des travailleurs salariés du secteur public et 1,1 % et 1,5 % des travailleurs salariés formels et informels du secteur privé, respectivement). Les travailleurs de 25 a 64 ans représentent l’écrasante majorité des emplois du secteur public (96,1 %), des emplois salariés formels (88,9 %) et des emplois salariés informels (environ 77,4 %). Ces parts atteignent 91,6 pour cent et 84,9 pour cent parmi les emplois non salariaux formels et informels, respectivement. Ce modeéle de cycle de vie est en partie attribuable a la composition de l’emploi par type au cours du cycle de vie et a la variation de incidence de l’informalité entre les types d’emploi. Les taux d’informalité en Tunisie sont plus élevés parmi les travailleurs non salariés, quicomprennent les employeurs, les travailleurs a leur compte et les travailleurs familiaux non rémunérés. Les jeunes et les travailleurs 4gés sont surreprésentés dans les types d’emploi présentant un risque plus élevé d’informalité ; ainsi, une grande partie des travailleurs familiaux non rémunérés sont jeunes, tandis que de nombreux employeurs et travailleurs a leur compte ont 65 ans ou plus. Enseignement. Le niveau de scolarité est la clé de ’accés aux emplois du secteur public. Prés d’un travailleur\n\nsur deux (45,4 %) employé dans le secteur public est\n\n129\n\n130\n\ntitulaire d’un dipléme universitaire, contre 21,6 % des salariés du secteur formel et 7,0 % des salariés du secteur informel. Les travailleurs diplo6més de Penseignement supérieur contribuent également a une part importante de l’emploi non salarié formel (30,7 %), mais seulement 6,5 % de l’emploi non salarié informel. Plus d’un travailleur sur deux dans l’emploi informel n’a jamais été scolarisé ou a seulement achevé sa scolarité primaire : 54,6 pour cent dans le cas de l’emploi salarié et 59,8 pour cent dans le cas de l’emploi non salarié. La part des travailleurs ayant suivi des études secondaires ne différe pas sensiblement d’un groupe a l’autre. ¢ Situation matrimoniale. Les différences dans la compo- sition de l’emploi entre les groupes selon la situation matrimoniale sont en grande partie attribuables a la distribution de l'emploi par age. La part des travailleurs célibataires est plus importante dans |’emploi salarié informel (48,7 %) que dans l’emploi salarié formel (31,3 %) et du secteur public (20,6 %) ou dans l’emploi non salarié formel (18,1 %), ce qui refléte Age plus jeune des travailleurs dans ces types d’emploi. En revanche, la part des travailleurs célibataires dans l’emploi formel non salarié est la plus faible, a 18,1 %, ce qui refléte la faible part des jeunes de 15 a 24 ans dans ce groupe. ¢ Lien avec le chef de famille. La composition de l’emploi par rapport au chef de ménage dans les différents groupes refléte en grande partie la répartition par sexe et la pyramide des ages de chaque groupe. En particulier la part des conjoints, pratiquement tous des femmes, est plus faible chez les travailleurs informels salariés (8,1 %) et non salariés (9,4 %), par rapport aux travailleurs formels salariés (17,8 %), formels non salariés (11,9 %) et du secteur public (24 %). Les jeunes de 15 4 24 ans représentent 44,2 % de l’emploi salarié informel, contre 26,9 %, 18,1 % et 14,8 % de l’emploi salarié formel, de l’emploi non salarié formel et de Pemploi dans le secteur public, respectivement. ¢ Revenu des ménages. Plus d’un travailleur du secteur public sur deux et un travailleur salarié ou non salarié du secteur formel sur deux font partie d’un ménage appartenant aux quatre déciles supérieurs (61,7 pour\n\ncent, 50,4 pour cent et 56,5 pour cent, respectivement).**\n\n“La distribution des travailleurs le long de la distribution de la consommation par habitant est basée sur les données de l’enquéte sur le budget des ménages de 2015, contrairement au reste de l’analyse, qui s’appuie sur l’Enquéte Nationale sur Emploi de 2019. De plus, en raison d@un manque d’informations dans l’enquéte sur le budget des ménages, la définition de l'emploi informel ne prend en compte que les travailleurs affiliés a la sécurité sociale plutét que la définition officielle introduite par PINS dans l’Enquéte Nationale sur Emploi de 2019 qui prend en compte Paccés aux congés payés et aux congés maladie dans les cas ott Paccés a la sécurité sociale n’est pas déclaré par les répondants. Paysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nSeuls environ 20,5 % des travailleurs salariés du secteur public, 29 % des travailleurs salariés du secteur formel et 23,7 % des travailleurs non salariés du secteur formel vivent dans des ménages faisant partie des 40 % inférieurs. Les travailleurs informels ne sont cependant pas tous moins bien lotis, notamment dans le cas des travailleurs informels non salariés. La distribution des travailleurs non salariés informels entre les déciles est a peu prés égale jusqu’au 8e décile ; ensuite, la part diminue modestement pour atteindre un minimum de 6,6 % dans le décile le plus élevé. Cependant, pour saisir les implications en termes de revenu dans des emplois formels et informels, la dimension du ménage est révélatrice. A part les ménages dont aucun membre ne travaille, qui, en Tunisie, représentaient environ\n\n22 pour cent de l’ensemble des ménages en 2015, les\n\nménages peuvent avoir des membres employés de maniére formelle ou informelle, et les ménages dont plus d’un membre travaille peuvent présenter un certain degré de formalité ou d’informalité. En excluant les ménages dont aucun membre ne travaille, les ménages ont donc été classés comme étant entiérement formels, entiérement informels ou mixtes. Environ 56 % des ménages étaient entiérement formels, 26,8 % entiérement informels et 16,8 % mixtes. Par rapport 4 un taux de pauvreté de 15,1 pour cent au niveau national, le taux de pauvreté des ménages entiérement formels était considérablement plus bas, a 9,5 pour cent, et le taux des ménages mixtes était estimé a 12,4 pour cent. Les ménages entiérement informels étaient nettement plus\n\nsusceptibles d’étre pauvres (26,7 %). Les emplois du secteur public, formel et informe! présentent des caractéristiques distinctes\n\n¢ Situation géographique. Environ 72 % de la population active se trouve en milieu urbain (Tableau 3.2). En comparaison, 82,3 % des travailleurs du secteur public, environ 80 % des travailleurs salariés formels et 85,8 % des travailleurs non salariés formels. En revanche, Pemploi informel est réparti plus équitablement entre les zones urbaines et rurales ; les parts rurales atteignent 62,5 pour cent et 58,5 pour cent de l’emploi informel salarié et non salarié, respectivement. La distribution régionale de l’emploi indique qu’environ 1 travailleur salarié du secteur public sur 3, 1 travailleur salarié du secteur privé formel sur 3 et environ 45 % des travailleurs non salariés formels habitent dans le Grand Tunis. La part correspondante est d’environ 20 pour cent dans le cas des travailleurs informels salariés et non\n\nsalariés.

La part des travailleurs sous contrat a durée indéterminée est nettement plus importante parmi les travailleurs du secteur public (plus de 85 %) que parmi les travailleurs salariés du secteur formel (57,5 %) et les travailleurs salariés du secteur informel (20,1 %). Les contrats 4 durée déterminée sont plus fréquents chez les salariés du secteur formel (24,8 %) et les travailleurs du secteur informel (26,1 %) que chez les travailleurs du secteur public (7,7 %). Les travailleurs informels sont plus exposés a la menace de la perte d’emploi. Plus d’un sur deux n’a pas de contrat. La part correspondante est estimée a 17,2 pour cent chez les travailleurs du secteur formel et 4 5,8 pour cent chez les travailleurs du secteur public. ¢ Taille de l’entreprise. Les travailleurs informels, salariés et non salariés, sont généralement employés dans des microentreprises. Prés de 65 % des travailleurs salariés informels et 89 % des travailleurs non salariés informels sont employés dans des entreprises de moins de six salariés, contre 24,9 % des travailleurs salariés formels et moins de 6 % des travailleurs du secteur public. La plupart des travailleurs formels non salariés sont actifs dans des micro-entreprises, ce qui est en partie une conséquence de la part importante de travailleurs 4 leur compte dans ce groupe. La part des travailleurs salariés dans les petites entreprises (six a neuf employés) est légérement plus importante dans le cas des travailleurs informels par rapport aux\n\ntravailleurs formels (10,4 % contre 6,5 %). Environ 19,0 % des salariés du secteur informel sont employés dans des entreprises comptant chacune plus de neuf employés, alors que les proportions sont de 59,7 % et 82,1 % parmi les salariés du secteur formel et du secteur public, respectivement. Les travailleurs a leur compte présentent le taux d’informalité le plus élevé ; pourtant, l’emploi salarié informel est celui qui contribue le plus a l’emploi total. A 29,0 pour cent, les taux d’informalité sont considérablement plus bas que la moyenne (43,9 pour cent) parmi les travailleurs salariés, et ils sont beaucoup plus élevés parmi les employeurs et les travailleurs a leur compte (Graphique 3.2 panel a).*® Cependant, en raison du grand nombre de travailleurs salariés en Tunisie, la contribution des employés informels a l'emploi total est la plus importante, avec 21,6 pour cent, suivie par 14,7 pour cent de travailleurs 4 leur compte, 4,9 pour cent d’employeurs et 2,6 pour cent de travailleurs familiaux non rémunérés (Graphique 3.2 panel b). La plupart des employés formels travaillent dans des unités de production formelles. En combinant le concept de formalité au niveau des travailleurs salariés avec celui de formalité au niveau des unités économiques qui les emploient, on constate que le chevauchement entre le statut de formalité des travailleurs salariés et des entreprises est élevé.

Les travailleurs salariés informels dans les entreprises informelles contribuent pour environ 24,0 % a l’emploi salarié total, tandis que les travailleurs salariés informels dans les entreprises formelles ne contribuent que pour\n\nenviron 5,6 %. Les taux d’informalité sont hétérogénes selon les caractér- istiques des travailleurs et les types d’emploi. Parmi les travailleurs salariés, les taux d’informalité sont plus élevés chez les hommes que chez les femmes (32,9 pour cent contre 22,8 pour cent), chez les jeunes de 15 a 25 ans (55,6 pour cent), chez les travailleurs jamais scolarisés (48,8 pour cent) ou ayant achevé leur scolarité primaire (40,7 pour cent), et chez les travailleurs qui vivent dans des ménages situés dans les trois déciles inférieurs de la distribution de la consommation (68,7 pour cent, 53,8 pour cent et 51,8 pour cent respectivement) (Tableau 3.3). Les taux d’informalité sont généralement plus élevés dans les emplois non salariés que parmi les travailleurs salariés. Il existe des différences importantes selon les caractéristiques des travailleurs. Premiérement, les femmes et les hommes employés comme travailleurs non salariés ne présentent pas de taux d’informalité trés différents (84 % contre 82 %). Deuxiémement, les jeunes travailleurs non salariés affichent des taux d’informalité plus élevés que les autres\n\ntranches d’ge, bien que l’écart soit plus faible par rapport\n\nGRAPHIQUE 3.3.

Troisitmement, pratiquement tous les travailleurs non salariés qui n’ont pas été scolarisés sont informels (95,5 %), et les taux d’informalité sont également élevés parmi les travailleurs ayant achevé leur scolarité primaire (88,9 %) et secondaire (82,4 %). La différence est grande en ce qui concerne le taux d’informalité entre les travailleurs salariés et non salariés titulaires d’un dipléme universitaire (8,6 % contre 52,1 %). Les taux d’informalité sont les plus élevés au bas de la distribution des revenus, mais, contrairement a ce qui se passe dans le cas de l’emploi salarié, les travailleurs non salariés au sommet de la distribution présentent des taux d’informalité élevés, estimés 4 42,9 pour cent, 38,8 pour cent et 27,5 pour cent dans les 8e, 9e et 10e déciles. Une telle tendance pourrait indiquer que l’informalité parmi les travailleurs non salariés, en particulier les employeurs et les travailleurs a leur compte, est davantage un choix\n\nqu’une option de dernier recours. Les taux d’informalité différent selon les caractéristiques de l’emploi, en particulier dans l’emploi salarié.

Cela se refléte dans les taux d’informalité par profession. Les travailleurs agricoles qualifiés, les travailleurs exergant des métiers élémentaires et les artisans et commergants affichent les taux d’informalité les plus élevés parmi les travailleurs salariés. Les travailleurs salariés sans contrat (64,1 %) et les travailleurs dans des microentreprises (61,8 %) et des petites entreprises (46,3 %) affichent des taux d’informalité considérablement plus élevés que la moyenne (43,9 %) des travailleurs salariés.

La corrélation avec la probabilité de travailler dans un emploi non salarié est insignifiante sur le plan économique. La situation géographique en termes de région ou de zone urbaine ou rurale est importante. Le fait de résider dans une zone urbaine augmente la probabilité de travailler comme salarié du secteur public (4,6 %) ou du secteur privé formel (3,8 %) et est associé a une probabilité plus faible de travailler comme travailleur informel 4 son compte (-4 %) ou comme travailleur familial non rémunéré (-2,5 %). La probabilité d’occuper un emploi salarié forme! dans le secteur privé est associée négativement dans l’ensemble des régions, a exception du Nord-Est par rapport au Grand Tunis. C’est le contraire qui se produit dans le cas des travailleurs salariés informels du Grand Tunis par rapport a toutes les autres régions. La régression tient compte également les données démographiques du ménage, a savoir la situation matrimoniale et le nombre d’enfants de 0 4 4 ans et de 5 a 14 ans dans le ménage, dans le but de saisir l’effet de dispositions de travail plus favorables au ménage et plus flexibles dans le cas d’emplois salariés formels dans les secteurs public et privé. La situation matrimoniale semble étre positivement associée a l’emploi salarié formel dans\n\nles secteurs public et privé. Tendances salariales, écarts salariaux et retombées économiques de |’éducation\n\nCette section tire parti des données sur les salaires recueillies par l'Institut national de la statistique (INS) dans le cadre de |’Enquéte Nationale sur l’Emploi (ENPE) et illustre en quoi les travailleurs bénéficient du marché du travail et quelles caractéristiques individuelles sont corrélées aux salaires. Bien qu’aucune information sur les revenus du travail ne soit disponible pour les travailleurs et les employeurs a leur compte, les salaires constituent la principale source de revenus du travail pour la majorité de la population, car plus de 3 travailleurs sur 4 en Tunisie travaillent pour un salaire. Cette section (1) présente les tendances récentes des salaires au niveau global et par caractéristiques des travailleurs et des emplois ; (2) étudie existence et les corrélations des écarts de rémunération entre hommes et femmes dans les secteurs privé et public, des écarts de rémunération entre travailleurs salariés dans\n\nles secteurs public et privé, et des écarts de rémunération\n\nentre travailleurs salariés formels et informels dans le secteur privé ; et (3) analyse les corrélats de rémunération,\n\nen particulier les retombées économiques de |’éducation.*”\n\nEVOLUTION DES SALAIRES\n\nEntre 2012 et 2019, les salaires mensuels moyens n’ont pas considérablement augmenté et, en 2019, le salaire mensuel moyen a été estimé a environ 600 TD. En 2012, le salaire mensuel moyen était estimé a environ 583 TD. Il est passé a environ 644 TD en 2017. Depuis 2017, la tendance a la hausse des salaires s’est inversée et le salaire mensuel moyen a diminué de plus de 3 % par an. En 2019, la moyenne s’est établie 4 environ 598 TD par mois (Graphique 3.5 panel a). Une tendance similaire est observée pour les salaires horaires moyens. En 2012, un salarié gagnait, en moyenne, 3,5 TD par heure travaillée. Cela a augmenté jusqu’a environ 4 TD en 2017, puis a diminué jusqu’a 3,7 TD en 2019 (Graphique 3.5 panel b). Sur la période 2012-19, le taux de croissance annualisé du salaire horaire moyen a été plus élevé que celui du salaire mensuel (environ 0,8 % contre 0,4 %) en raison d’une baisse du nombre moyen d’heures de travail, qui est passé d’environ 45,3 heures par semaine en 2012 a 43,1 heures\n\npar semaine en 2019. 4’Les statistiques salariales présentées dans ce chapitre renvoient aux salaires mensuels et horaires exprimés en prix au cours de 2019 pour les salariés de 15 4 64 ans. Les salaires ne comprennent pas les primes et les avantages en nature. Comme les travailleurs sont autorisés 4 déclarer leur dernier salaire selon une période de référence de leur choix, les salaires sont d@abord convertis en valeurs mensuelles, c’est a dire la période de référence la plus couramment utilisée dans l’enquéte. Les salaires déclarés a la semaine ou a la journée sont convertis en valeurs mensuelles en multipliant les valeurs hebdomadaires et quotidiennes par le nombre de semaines et de jours travaillés au cours du mois précédent, respectivement. Lorsque les données sur les semaines et les jours travaillés sont absentes, les valeurs salariales sont multipliées par 4,33 (nombre de semaines dans un mois) et 22 (nombre de jours de travail dans un mois), respectivement. Cela signifie que l’on suppose que les travailleurs ont travaillé 4 temps plein au cours du mois précédent. En outre, moins de 0,05 % des travailleurs salariés, a exception de 2014 (4,4 %) et 2019 (0,5 %), déclarent leur dernier salaire selon une unité de temps inconnue. Le montant du salaire déclaré a été utilisé sans appliquer de facteur de conversion dans ce cas. Les salaires horaires ont été calculés en divisant les valeurs salariales mensuelles par le nombre d’heures travaillées la semaine précédant l’entretien, multiplié par 4,33. La question concernant le nombre d’heures travaillées par semaine renvoie a tous les emplois dans tous les cycles d’enquéte jusqu’en 2018 et 4 Pemploi principal uniquement a partir du cycle 2019 de lenquéte. Pour des raisons de comparabilité, les travailleurs salariés exercant deux emplois ont été exclus de l’analyse. Cela conduit a l’exclusion de moins de 0,5 % des travailleurs salariés chaque année. Toutes les valeurs de salaire horaire qui s’écartent de plus (ou moins) de 3 écarts types de la moyenne pour chaque année d’enquéte sont identifiées comme des valeurs aberrantes et sont exclues de l’analyse. Les statistiques salariales se basent sur les salaires parmi la population des travailleurs salariés qui déclarent leur salaire au cours de lenquéte. La part des travailleurs salariés qui n’ont pas répondu a la question concernant le montant du salaire est passée d’environ 25 % en 2012 a environ 53 % en 2019. 141\n\n142\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nGRAPHIQUE 3.5.

Les secteurs secondaire et des services paient, en moyenne, davantage que l’agriculture, mais |’écart salarial par secteur s’est réduit au fil du temps. En 2012, le salaire mensuel moyen était environ 54 % plus élevé dans le secteur secondaire que dans l’agriculture, et le secteur des services payait plus de deux fois plus que l’agriculture (123 %) (Graphique 3.6 panel a). Entre 2012 et 2015, Pécart salarial entre les secteurs a considérablement diminué et, depuis lors, il s’est élargi de fagon modeste. En 2019, Pécart salarial était estimé a environ 48 % dans le secteur secondaire et a environ 93 % dans le secteur des services. La dynamique observée dans |’écart salarial est le sous- produit de deux facteurs. Le salaire mensuel moyen dans Pagriculture a augmenté plus rapidement jusqu’en 2017 et a ensuite moins diminué que dans les deux autres secteurs. Sur Vensemble de la période (2012-19), les salariés agricoles ont connu un gain cumulé de leurs salaires moyens d’environ 16 %, tandis que les salariés du secteur secondaire ont affiché une hausse cumulée d’environ 11 %.

Les travailleurs dans l’administration publique et dans les sociétés publiques sont payés, en moyenne, davantage que les travailleurs du secteur privé et ont enregistré des augmentations de salaire plus importantes au fil du temps. Les salaires mensuels moyens des travailleurs ont été environ 1,8 fois plus élevés dans l’administration publique et les sociétés publiques que dans le secteur privé (Graphique 3.7 panel a). Aprés un ralentissement au lendemain de la révolution de 2011, les salaires mensuels moyens dans l’administration et les sociétés publiques ont commencé a augmenter rapidement jusqu’en 2017. Sur la période 2018-19, les salaires moyens ont diminué dans les secteurs privé et public (Graphique 3.7, panel b). Laugmentation globale des salaires mensuels moyens a été denviron 9,2 % dans le secteur privé et d’environ 6,7 %\n\ndans l’administration et les sociétés publiques. La prime salariale des travailleurs titulaires d’un diplome universitaire a considérablement diminué. Comme prévu, le salaire mensuel moyen augmente avec le niveau de scolarité atteint par les travailleurs. Par exemple, en 2012, un travailleur ayant suivi des études supérieures a gagné, en moyenne, prés de 2,8 fois le montant gagné par un travailleur n’ayant pas fait d’études, tandis qu’un travailleur ayant suivi des études secondaires a gagné environ 1,6 fois le montant gagné par un travailleur n’ayant pas fait d’études (Graphique 3.8 panel a). La dynamique salariale différe considérablement selon le niveau d’études des travailleurs. Si les travailleurs qui n’ont jamais fait d’études ou qui ont achevé leur scolarité primaire ont d’abord obtenu\n\ndes gains importants puis, plus récemment, des réductions\n\nmodestes de leur salaire mensuel ; les travailleurs ayant suivi des études secondaires et, surtout, les travailleurs diplémés de l’enseignement supérieur ont enregistré des gains modestes puis, plus récemment, des réductions importantes de leur salaire mensuel (Graphique 3.8 panel b). Le salaire mensuel moyen des travailleurs diplomés de Penseignement supérieur était inférieur de 8 % en 2019 par rapport a 2012. Les travailleurs ayant suivi des études secondaires ont bénéficié d’une augmentation des salaires moyens jusqu’en 2017, mais celle-ci a ensuite été annulée. Les travailleurs ayant achevé leur scolarité primaire ont bénéficié d’une augmentation cumulée de 14 pour cent, et les travailleurs n’ayant pas fait d’études ont bénéficié d’une croissance cumulée de plus de 19 pour cent. Ces tendances sont cohérentes avec un marché du travail caractérisé par une abondance de personnes ayant un niveau d’études secondaire et supérieure qui ne peuvent étre absorbées en raison d’un manque de demande pour ce type de travailleurs,\n\net beaucoup d’entre eux se retrouvent au chomage.**\n\nECARTS DE REMUNERATION ENTRE HOMMES ET FEMMES\n\nLes disparités entre les hommes et les femmes quant a la participation au marché du travail sont en partie le sous-\n\nproduit d’un processus de négociation entre les conjoints,\n\n“SLe reste du chapitre souligne que les retombées économiques de lenseignement supérieur, en tenant compte des autres caractéristiques observables des travailleurs, ont diminué au fil du temps. 143\n\n144\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nGRAPHIQUE 3.8.

Cette section examine l’existence d’écarts de rémunération entre hommes et femmes limitant ainsi l’analyse a la population des travailleurs salariés, qui, dans le cas de la Tunisie, représente environ 75 pour cent de la population active et plus de 85 pour cent des femmes actives. En Tunisie, les femmes sont plus susceptibles que les hommes d’occuper un emploi salarié dans le secteur public (voir Tableau 3.1). Il existe des différences importantes dans le niveau d’études et la distribution entre les professions des hommes et des femmes qui travaillent dans les secteurs privé et public (voir chapitre 2). Par exemple, les femmes employées comme salariées sont, en moyenne, plus instruites que les hommes, et la proportion de femmes ayant suivi un enseignement supérieur est beaucoup plus élevée dans le secteur public que dans le secteur privé. La part des femmes ayant suivi un enseignement supérieur dans le secteur public a également augmenté au fil du temps. Chez les hommes, la part correspondante est restée constante dans le temps et est estimée étre inférieure d’environ 30 points de pourcentage a celle des femmes. Dans le secteur privé, les femmes occupent principalement des emplois peu ou moyennement qualifiés, tandis que dans le secteur public, la plupart des femmes occupent des emplois hautement qualifiés. Pour tenir compte de ces différences considérables, l’analyse des écarts de rémunération entre hommes et femmes est menée séparément pour les salariés du secteur privé et ceux du\n\nsecteur public. Dans le secteur privé, les femmes gagnent, en moyenne, 0,83 dollar de ’heure pour 1 dollar de ’heure pour les hommes, et |’écart se creuse le long de la distribution des salaires. L’écart salarial inconditionnel entre hommes et femmes, qui permet de saisir les différences salariales sans tenir compte des différences de caractéristiques dans la masse d’hommes et de femmes actifs, indique qu’en moyenne en Tunisie en 2019, une femme travaillant dans le secteur privé gagnait environ 16 pour cent de moins par heure travaillée qu’un homme. Vécart salarial inconditionnel entre hommes et femmes dans les salaires horaires a augmenté le long de la distribution des salaires horaires, passant d’environ —16 pour cent parmi les 20 salaires les plus bas 4 environ —24 pour cent parmi les 20 salaires les plus hauts en 2019 (Graphique 3.9 panel b). En 2012, l’écart de rémunération entre hommes et femmes présentait une forme en U inversé, avec un minimum estimé 4-13 % autour de la médiane (Graphique 3.9\n\npanel a). Dans le secteur public, les femmes gagnent, en moyenne, 46 % de plus que les hommes par heure de travail, et Pécart est plus de deux fois plus grand parmi les hauts revenus. Les femmes employées dans le secteur public ont gagné environ 9 % de plus par mois que les hommes en 2019. Vécart en faveur des femmes est amélioré - il était de 5 % en 2012. La différence inconditionnelle est considérablement plus importante pour le salaire horaire.

Vécart plus important entre les salaires horaires et les salaires mensuels est imputable aux différences dans le temps de travail. Les femmes employées dans le secteur public travaillent, en moyenne, moins d’heures que les hommes. LVécart se creuse le long de la distribution, et la prime en faveur des femmes s’est accrue au fil du temps (voir Graphique 3.9 panels c et d). En 2019, l’écart salarial inconditionnel entre hommes et femmes en matiére de salaire horaire variait d’environ 3 % au Se percentile 4 environ 25 % a la médiane. Il a culminé 4 plus de 110 % aux alentours du 75e percentile. Il est tombé a environ 80 % chez les\n\ntravailleurs du 85e percentile. En tenant compte de caractéristiques observables, l’analyse révéle qu’en 2019, les femmes employées dans le secteur privé ont gagné, en moyenne, environ 18,5 % de moins que les hommes par heure travaillée ; dans le secteur public, les femmes ont gagné 33 % de plus que les hommes par heure travaillée. Compte tenu des différences notables entre certaines caractéristiques des hommes et des femmes employés dans les secteurs public et privé, a savoir le niveau d’études et la profession, l’écart salarial inconditionnel n’est pas un bon indicateur de l’ampleur de la discrimination sur le marché du travail.

LVécart\n\n“Les régressions tiennent compte d’un polynéme du second degré pour Page, et de variables muettes individuelles pour les cohortes d’année de naissance, le niveau de scolarité, la région et la zone (résidence en milieu urbain ou rural), la profession, la branche et le secteur d’activité, autrement dit le domaine d’emploi dans le secteur public (administration publique, sociétés publiques) et dans le secteur privé (entreprise privée tunisienne ou étrangére ou mixte, entreprise familiale privée, etc.), le type de contrat (a durée déterminée, 4 durée indéterminée ou sans contrat) et l’affiliation a la sécurité sociale (Caisse nationale de sécurité sociale, autre ou sans affiliation). a été estimé a environ 18,5 % en 2019, en moyenne, et a oscillé autour de ce niveau au fil du temps. Dans le secteur public, les femmes ont recu une prime de salaire horaire environ 33 % en 2019, contre environ 18 % en 2012. Une grande partie de l’écart moyen entre les hommes et les femmes dans le secteur public s’explique par les différences de caractéristiques des hommes et des femmes. Les estimations issues d’une double décomposition Blinder- Oaxaca indiquent dans quelle mesure les différences observées dans les salaires horaires entre les hommes et les femmes sont imputables a des différences dans les caractéristiques observables des deux groupes, c’est-a-dire la composante expliquée, et a des caractéristiques non observées ou a des traitements différents des hommes\n\net des femmes, c’est-a-dire la composante inexpliquée\n\nNiveau d’emploi et de rémunération\n\n(Graphique 3.10, panels a et b).*° Dans le secteur public, les composantes expliquées et inexpliquées fonctionnent en sens inverse. Les différences de caractéristiques observables exercent un effet positif sur l’écart de salaire horaire entre les hommes et les femmes qui le renforce en faveur des femmes. Parmi les caractéristiques observables, le fait que les femmes dans le secteur public soient plus instruites que les hommes et qu’elles occupent des emplois a forte rémunération (cadres et spécialistes), fait pencher lécart en faveur des femmes (Graphique 3.10 panel d). Ceci est conforme aux faits stylisés présentés au chapitre 2, selon lesquels les femmes dans le secteur public sont relativement plus concentrées dans les professions a forte rémunération et ont, en moyenne, un niveau d’études plus élevé. Le creusement de l’écart entre les hommes et les femmes au fil du temps est en grande partie imputable a lamélioration de ces caractéristiques chez les femmes employées dans le secteur public par rapport aux hommes. En revanche, la composante inexpliquée a un effet négatif sur le salaire horaire, mais cet effet est modeste. Cette composante est associée a une structure salariale différente ou a des caractéristiques non observées qui rendraient, en\n\nmoyenne, les hommes plus productifs que les femmes. Dans le secteur privé, |’écart de rémunération entre hommes et femmes est en grande partie inexpliqué. Dans le secteur privé également, les deux composantes (expliquée et inexpliquée) vont dans des directions opposées la plupart des années (Graphique 3.10, panel b). La plus grande part de la différence de salaire horaire est attribuable a la composante inexpliquée qui exerce un effet négatif important sur la disparité entre les hommes et les femmes. Bien que la composante expliquée fasse passer la disparité entre les hommes et les femmes en zone positive la plupart des années, sa contribution est relativement faible et l’écart global entre les hommes et les femmes est négatif. Parmi les caractéristiques observables, les différences de niveau de scolarité et de profession contribuent positivement,\n\ntandis que les différences démographiques, en particulier\n\n°° La décomposition de Blinder-Oaxaca est utilisée pour évaluer dans quelle mesure les différences de salaires horaires entre les hommes et les femmes sont imputables a des différences dans les caractéristiques observées et non observées des deux groupes. Leffet associé 4 la premiére différence constitue la composante expliquée du différentiel, également appelée effet de caractéristiques, de composition ou de dotation, en ce sens qu'elle refléte la partie du différentiel associée aux différences de groupe dans les attributs individuels observables (par exemple, le niveau de scolarité, le secteur @activité, industrie, la profession). Leffet la deuxiéme différence est appelé la composante inexpliquée. Il s’agit de la partie de l’écart salarial qui résulte de ’évaluation différenciée des caractéristiques des femmes et des hommes sur le marché du travail, en raison de différences dans les caractéristiques non observables ou de structures de rémunération inégales entre les deux groupes. une plus grande proportion d’hommes actifs dans les zones rurales et a des Ages supérieurs a 45 ans, exercent un effet\n\nnégatif important sur |’écart salarial. Dans le secteur privé, l’écart de salaire horaire conditionnel entre les hommes et les femmes passe d’environ -16 % en bas de l’échelle a plus de -25 % en haut de I’échelle.*! Dans le secteur privé, la grande majorité de la différence de salaire horaire entre les hommes et les femmes est concentrée dans la moitié supérieure de la distribution (Graphique 3.11 panels a, b et c). Il était estimé 4—-15,6 % au 10e centile, -14,7 % a la médiane et —24,9 % au 90e centile en 2019. En 2012-19, il a diminué dans la partie inférieure et augmenté dans la partie médiane, tandis qu’il est resté a peu prés constant dans la partie supérieure. Les résultats de la décomposition de ce secteur montrent que les composantes expliquées et inexpliquées opérent dans des directions opposées a la base, alors qu’elles poussent toutes deux la disparité entre les hommes et les femmes en territoire négatif a la médiane, en particulier ces derniéres années, et au sommet (Graphique 3.11 panels d, ¢ et f). La composante inexpliquée contribue le plus a la disparité entre les hommes et les femmes tout au long de la distribution et particuliérement au bas de |’échelle. Les caractéristiques de l’emploi, suivies de la profession et du niveau de scolarité, sont les principaux facteurs de l’effet en faveur des femmes de la composante expliquée en bas de l’échelle. Au milieu et au sommet de la distribution, les différences entre les hommes et les femmes dans les caractéristiques de l’emploi, le secteur industriel et les différences démographiques font pencher la disparité entre les hommes et les femmes en faveur des hommes, et leffet positif que jouent le niveau de scolarité et la profession est trop modeste pour annuler l’effet des autres\n\ncaractéristiques. Dans le secteur public, les disparités entre les hommes et les femmes sont les plus faibles aux extrémités de la distribution et augmentent au milieu, selon un modéle en U inversé. En 2019, au 10e centile, l’écart de salaire horaire conditionnel était estimé a environ 6 %, en territoire positif par rapport a 2012 (-9,6 %), a environ 36,0 % au niveau de la médiane (contre 17,8 % en 2012) et a environ 20,4 % au 90e centile (similaire 4 l’écart observé en 2012, 19,2 %) (voir Graphique 3.12, panels a, b et c).

Pendant ce temps, au sommet, la composante inexpliquée joue un effet négatif, mais l’ampleur de l’effet n’est pas suffisamment importante pour annuler effet positif des caractéristiques observables pour les femmes. En outre, au sommet et a la édiane, la composante expliquée joue le réle majeur, et, dans la tranche inférieure de la distribution, la composante inexpliquée contribue 4 60 % de l’écart de rémunération entre hommes et femmes. Comme dans le cas de la moyenne, les différences de niveau de scolarité et de profession sont les principaux moteurs de l’effet positif de la composante expliquée 4 chacun des percentiles sélectionnés, et les différences de composition du secteur d’activité exercent un effet positif uniquement au sommet (Graphique 3.12 panels d, e et f). Dans ensemble, ces résultats suggérent que, dans le secteur privé, l’écart salarial en faveur des hommes est, dans une certaine mesure, imputable a des différences systématiques dans les emplois auxquels les femmes ont accés, et que le niveau d’études plus élevé des femmes ne suffit pas 4 compenser ces obstacles. Le principal facteur a Porigine de l’écart de rémunération entre hommes et femmes dans le secteur privé reste toutefois lié 4 des différences de caractéristiques non observables ou a la structure de rémunération, autrement dit 4 une structure de rémunération inégale en défaveur des femmes. En revanche, les femmes du secteur public bénéficient d’une prime salariale par rapport aux hommes grace aux dotations nettement plus productives des femmes et méme si la composante inexpliquée joue en faveur des hommes au\n\nsommet de la distribution. Les bas salaires des femmes dans le secteur privé peuvent réduire les incitations des femmes a rejoindre la population active. Les femmes continueront probablement a assumer la majeure partie de la charge du ménage dans les taches ménagéres et les soins a la famille en raison de la division sexuelle des réles assignés par la société aux hommes et aux femmes (Banque mondiale 2021a). Ces activités entrent en concurrence avec le temps que les femmes consacrent au travail sur le marché de l’emploi. Vécart salarial est susceptible d’empécher certaines femmes d’entrer sur le marché du travail ou de les pousser 4 rechercher des carriéres moins compétitives, moins rémunératrices et offrant une plus grande flexibilité au travail. La réduction et l’élimination de l’écart de rémunération entre hommes et femmes dans le secteur privé peuvent aider a accroitre la participation des femmes et contribuer a promouvoir\n\nune croissance inclusive et a réaliser le plein potentiel de\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nléconomie, en particulier chez les femmes peu instruites. Par ailleurs, la ségrégation professionnelle et la division sexuelle des réles assignés par la société aux hommes et aux femmes peuvent contribuer a creuser |’écart de rémunération entre hommes et femmes. Les données du dernier cycle effectué de l’Enquéte Nationale sur |’Emploi montrent qu’en 2017, les femmes et les hommes avaient tendance 4 travailler dans des secteurs différents de Péconomie. Lindustrie manufacturiére (textiles, produits mécaniques et équipements électriques), le commerce et les services sociaux et culturels sont les trois principaux secteurs d’emploi des femmes dans le secteur privé, tandis que la construction, l’agriculture et le commerce dominent chez les hommes dans le secteur privé. Les différences entre les hommes et les femmes dans le travail dans le secteur industriel, la profession et la taille de l’entreprise\n\ncontribuent a creuser l’écart de rémunération. DISPARITES SALARIALES ENTRE LES SECTEURS\n\nLes travailleurs employés dans les secteurs public et privé présentent des caractéristiques observables différentes, tout comme les travailleurs formels et informels employés dans le secteur privé. Cette section étudie l’existence écarts salariaux entre les travailleurs salariés du secteur décarts sal: tre les t Il | di t public et du secteur privé et l’existence d’écarts salariaux entre les travailleurs formels et informels conditionnés par un ensemble de caractéristiques individuelles et\n\nprofessionnelles observables. Les travailleurs du secteur privé formel (informel) ont gagné, en moyenne, 0,65 $ (0,50 $) pour 1,00 $ gagné par les travailleurs du secteur public en 2019. Les écarts de salaires moyens inconditionnels entre les salariés du secteur public et ceux du secteur privé étaient considérables et, dans le secteur privé, entre les salariés du secteur formel et ceux du secteur informel. La densité des salaires mensuels des salariés employés dans le secteur public a été déplacée vers la droite de la densité des salaires mensuels des travailleurs du secteur privé, et il n’y a qu’un chevauchement partiel (Graphique 3.13- panel a). Une plus grande proportion de travailleurs du secteur public recevaient donc des salaires élevés par rapport aux travailleurs du secteur privé. En revanche, la fonction de densité des travailleurs formels et informels du secteur privé montre un chevauchement important. La densité des salaires des travailleurs informels s’est légérement déplacée vers la gauche de la densité des travailleurs formels. Une part plus importante des travailleurs salariés informels gagne de faibles salaires par rapport aux\n\ntravailleurs salariés formels.

Les grandes différences sont évidentes si l’on examine les fonctions de distribution cumulative, qui indiquent la proportion de travailleurs salariés dont les salaires tombent en dessous dun niveau donné, illustrées dans le Graphique 3.13 panel b. Par exemple, moins de 25 pour cent des salariés du secteur public ont un salaire de 600 DT ou moins, alors que le pourcentage est d’environ 67 pour cent et 80 pour cent\n\ndans le cas des salariés du secteur formel et informel. ECARTS SALARIAUX CONDITIONNELS ENTRE LES TRAVAILLEURS DU SECTEUR PUBLIC ET CEUX DU SECTEUR PRIVE\n\nEn 2019, conditionné aux caractéristiques observables, les salariés employés dans le secteur public ont gagné, en moyenne, plus de deux fois plus que les salariés du secteur privé par heure travaillée. Il existe des différences considérables entre les travailleurs salariés employés dans les secteurs public et privé, notamment en ce qui concerne le sexe, |’age, le niveau de scolarité, la situation géographique, l’industrie et la profession. Il est donc crucial d’étudier l’existence d’écarts salariaux tout en tenant compte des caractéristiques observables. Les écarts de salaire horaire conditionnels sont estimés au moyen\n\nd’équations de salaire et sont indiqués dans le tableau\n\nsuivant Graphique 3.14, panel a.** Les résultats indiquent qu’en 2019, les travailleurs salariés du secteur public ont été payés, en moyenne, plus de deux fois le montant payé par heure travaillée aux travailleurs du secteur privé. Vécart salarial horaire estimé entre le secteur public et le secteur privé est passé d’environ 112 % en 2012 a 89 % en 2015, puis a augmenté pour atteindre environ 106 % en 2016-19. Une majeure partie de l’écart moyen des salaires horaires entre le secteur public et le secteur privé s’explique par les différences de caractéristiques des salariés employés dans les deux secteurs. Les estimations issues d’une double décomposition de Oaxaca-Blinder indiquent que la composante expliquée contribue pour toutes les années, sauf 2012, a hauteur de 50 % ou plus a l’écart estimé (Graphique 3.14 panel b). Les différences de caractéristiques observables exercent un effet positif sur ’écart de salaire horaire qui le renforce en faveur des travailleurs du secteur public.

On constate également des caractéristiques non observables ou une prime salariale en faveur des travailleurs du secteur public. JEUNES DIPLOMES UNIVERSITAIRES : CHOMAGE ET PRIME SALARIALE DANS LE SECTEUR PUBLIC\n\nEn 2019, le salaire mensuel moyen d’un jeune de 25 a 34 ans, titulaire d’un dipléme universitaire et employé dans ladministration publique était estimé a environ 1 030 TD, ce qui se compare a environ 1 244 TD dans le\n\ncas des sociétés publiques et a 734 TD et 466 TD dans le cas d’un employé formel et informel du secteur privé, respectivement (Graphique 3.15). Un diplémé universitaire peut donc s’attendre a gagner, en moyenne, environ 40 % de plus en tant que fonctionnaire qu’un employé formel du secteur privé et 1,2 fois le montant t que gagnent les employés informels. Lécart entre les salaires horaires était encore plus important, car les employés du secteur public ont tendance a travailler moins longtemps que les employés du secteur privé. Le salaire horaire moyen d’un diplémé universitaire de 25 a 34 ans a été estimé a environ 8,0 TD dans l’administration publique et a 3,8 TD et 2,7 TD en tant qu’employé formel et informel dans le secteur privé, respectivement. Cela s’ajoute aux indemnités, a la sécurité\n\nNiveau d’emploi et de rémunération\n\nGRAPHIQUE 3.15.

Parmi les jeunes diplémés de l’enseignement supérieur, le secteur public paie, en moyenne, environ 120 % de plus par heure travaillée que le secteur privé. Etant donné que les travailleurs employés dans le secteur public et le secteur privé différent considérablement en termes de caractéristiques observables, les écarts salariaux conditionnels sont un meilleur indicateur pour savoir si le travail dans le secteur public propose un salaire horaire plus élevé que le travail dans le secteur privé. En 2019, les salariés de 25 a 34 ans titulaires d’un dipléme universitaire et employés dans le secteur public, qui comprend l’administration publique et les sociétés publiques, ont été payés, en moyenne, environ 120 % de plus par heure travaillée par rapport aux travailleurs du secteur privé. Ce chiffre est legerement supérieur a |’écart moyen estimé parmi tous les travailleurs salariés (estimé 4 106 % en 2019). Cet écart est en grande partie imputable a des différences dans les caractéristiques observables. La double décomposition de Oaxaca-Blinder de l’écart de salaire horaire conditionnel indique qu’environ 90 % de la différence est imputable a des différences dans les caractéristiques observées. Les caractéristiques qui comptent le plus pour expliquer Pécart salarial sont la profession, le type de contrat, le lieu de travail et l’accés a la sécurité sociale. Ainsi, les jeunes\n\ndiplomés de l’enseignement supérieur ont plus de chances\n\nGRAPHIQUE 3.16.

Bien qu’il existe également des caractéristiques non observables et une prime salariale en faveur des travailleurs salariés du secteur public, cette composante contribue a hauteur de 10 % environ a l’écart salarial (Graphique 3.16). Cela souléve la question de savoir si les attentes d’un salaire plus élevé en tant que fonctionnaire, en grande partie attribuables aux caractéristiques des emplois concernés, font augmenter le salaire d’acceptation des jeunes diplémés universitaires et les incitent 4 postuler un emploi dans le secteur public en attendant.*’ La question est donc de savoir ce que pourraient faire les jeunes ayant obtenu le méme niveau d’études que\n\nles fonctionnaires. Prés d’un jeune de 25-34 ans sur deux employé dans Vadministration publique en 2015 a obtenu un certificat d’études supérieures. Parmi eux, 17,2 pour cent avaient un dipléme en sciences humaines, contre 12,5 pour cent\n\ndans le secteur privé, suivis par 16,2 pour cent ayant un\n\nSII est difficile de fournir des preuves directes concernant la durée de attente pour décrocher un emploi dans l’administration publique, car il faudrait des données sur le nombre de demandes d’emploi et les postes A pourvoir pour pouvoir construire des mesures de l’ampleur de la « file d’attente » comme nombre de candidats par offre d’emploi. Un exemple en est l'étude de Krueger (1988), qui constate que le taux de candidature aux emplois au fédéral aux Etats-Unis augmente a mesure que le ratio entre les revenus du gouvernement et ceux du secteur privé s’accroit, bien que ce taux ne soit pas lié au niveau relatif des avantages sociaux. 154\n\ndipléme en économie, en gestion ou en droit, ce qui est nettement inférieur au méme groupe (25,5 pour cent) dans le secteur privé (Graphique 3.17). La part des ingénieurs, a 5,8 %, était trois fois plus faible dans l’administration publique que dans le secteur privé (19,7 %), tandis que la part des jeunes ayant un dipléme en médecine ou en pharmacie était environ deux fois plus importante dans Padministration publique que dans le secteur privé (4,8 % contre 1,9 %). La part des jeunes titulaires d’une maitrise était estimée a 10,3 % dans l’administration publique et 4 15,8 % dans le secteur privé, tandis que la part des employés titulaires d’un doctorat était environ quatre fois plus importante dans l’administration publique (4,3 % contre 0,8 %). Moins d’un diplémé universitaire sur deux ne travaillant pas comme fonctionnaire est employé, et environ un sur quatre occupe un emploi salarié formel dans une société publique ou dans le secteur privé. Environ 46 % des jeunes de 25 a 34 ans titulaires d’un dipléme universitaire et ne travaillant pas comme fonctionnaires avaient un emploi en 2015. De ce groupe, prés de 55 % étaient employés dans des sociétés publiques (17 %) ou de facon formelle dans le secteur privé (38 %) (Graphique 3.18 panel a). Environ 29,2 % étaient des employés informels, et le reste était réparti de maniére a peu prés égale entre les employeurs et les travailleurs 4 leur compte, plus un résiduel de 1,8 % de travailleurs familiaux non rémunérés. Il est difficile de savoir sicertains des jeunes ne travaillant pas pour l’administration\n\npublique considéraient leur emploi comme une solution\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\ntemporaire en attendant de décrocher leur emploi de réve dans le secteur public ou bien comme une bonne solution adéquate. La distribution par quintile des dépenses des ménages par habitant indique que la part des travailleurs informels, en particulier les employés informels et les travailleurs familiaux non rémunérés, est considérablement plus importante dans la tranche inférieure de la distribution (Graphique 3.18 panel b). Il n’est pas exclu qu’une partie des jeunes qui appartiennent a des ménages moins aisés travaillent dans le secteur privé, en attendant de pouvoir\n\naccéder a un emploi dans l’administration publique. Les autres sont soit au chémage, soit inactifs, et leur incidence est plus importante dans la tranche inférieure de la distribution. Parmi les diplémés universitaires qui n’étaient pas employés dans l’administration publique en 2015, environ 46 % avaient un emploi ailleurs, et les 54 % restants étaient soit au chémage (39,6 %), soit inactifs (13,9 %) (Graphique 3.19). Les jeunes diplémés de Penseignement supérieur appartiennent principalement a la classe moyenne et supérieure et, par conséquent, la distribution des jeunes chémeurs et inactifs est également orientée vers la partie moyenne et l’extrémité supérieure de la distribution. Le taux de jeunes chémeurs ou inactifs, par quintile de la distribution des dépenses des ménages par habitant, a diminué d’environ 72 pour cent dans le quintile le plus bas a environ 40 pour cent dans le quintile le plus haut.

Cela peut étre lié au fait que les femmes ont tendance a assumer la plus grande partie de la charge des responsabilités ménagéres lorsqu’elles se marient. La grande majorité des jeunes chémeurs et inactifs n’ont jamais travaillé auparavant (plus de 78 % et 71 %, respectivement), et ceux qui ont travaillé dans le passé ne l’ont fait que pour de courtes périodes, généralement jusqu’a six mois au cours de Pannée précédant l’enquéte. La création d’emplois adéquats en quantité limitée dans le secteur privé, la division sexuelle des rdles assignés par la société aux hommes et aux femmes et une prime salariale importante dans le secteur public sont des causes plausibles du taux élevé de périodes sans emploi observé chez les diplémés universitaires. Les données a notre disposition ne permettent pas de répondre de maniére définitive a la question de savoir pourquoi plus d’un diplémé universitaire de 25 a 34 ans sur 2 est a la recherche d’un emploi ou inactif. Néanmoins, les éléments illustrés ci-dessus permettent de corroborer certaines hypothéses. Premiérement, les jeunes inactifs titulaires d’un dipléme universitaire sont principalement des femmes de 20 a 30 ans, mariées 4 des hommes qui travaillent, appartenant a la classe moyenne et vivant dans des ménages aisés. Le statut d’inactivité est probablement attribuable au réle que les femmes jouent dans le ménage lorsqu’elles se marient, ainsi qu’a la création limitée d’emplois adéquats dans le secteur privé pour les diplémés universitaires. Deuxiémement, les dipl6més sans emploi sont en grande partie des\n\njeunes hommes vivant chez leurs parents, l’incidence est considérable dans la tranche inférieure de la distribution. Cela peut indiquer que la principale raison des taux de chémage élevés est la rareté des emplois adéquats dans le secteur privé, ainsi que l’espoir d’accéder 4 des emplois a forte rémunération dans le secteur public. La plus grande incidence du chémage 4 la base de la distribution peut s’expliquer par l’emploi des membres du ménage dans l’administration publique. Les estimations d’une régression multinomiale indiquent qu’aprés avoir tenu compte d’autres caractéristiques, l’emploi des membres du ménage de 35 ans ou plus dans le secteur public est positivement corrélé avec la probabilité que les diplomés universitaires travaillent dans l’administration publique. Les explications possibles de ces effets peuvent inclure des facteurs d’attraction et de répulsion. Dans le premier cas, la présence d’un fonctionnaire dans le ménage peut inciter davantage 4 participer aux concours. Dans le second cas, la présence d’un membre du ménage employé dans le secteur public peut augmenter les chances d’étre embauché dans le secteur public grace 4 un effet de réseau. Sur la base d’entretiens qualitatifs, Brockmeyer, Khatrouch et Raballand (2015) affirment qu’avant la révolution de 2011, le systéme de recrutement de la fonction publique fonctionnait bien, malgré des interférences occasionnelles en faveur de candidats bénéficiant du soutien du parti politique dominant ; le systéme s’est détérioré par la suite. Vamnistie générale de 2011 et les dispositions exceptionnelles adoptées en 2011/12, qui ont permis le recrutement direct, ainsi que la régularisation des travailleurs contractuels et temporaires entre 2011 et 2014 peuvent avoir contribué a favoriser les candidats ayant de « bonnes relations » plut6t\n\nNiveau d’emploi et de rémunération\n\nGRAPHIQUE 3.21.

Pour ces raisons, les retombées économiques de suivre une année supplémentaire d’études ne sont pas fournis.

Les retombées économiques de |’éducation, en particulier pour l’enseignement supérieur, sont appréciables et n’augmentent pas de facon monotone avec le niveau d’études. En 2019, les travailleurs ayant achevé leur scolarité primaire ont bénéficié d’une prime d’environ 12,6 % par heure travaillée par rapport aux travailleurs jamais scolarisés (Graphique 3.22). Venseignement secondaire a donné lieu 4 une prime supplémentaire d’environ 9,1 % (21,7 % - 12,6 %) par rapport a l’enseignement primaire, et P’enseignement supérieur 4 une prime supplémentaire de 26,1 % (47,8 % - 21,7 %) par rapport a l’enseignement secondaire. Cela est cohérent avec les preuves existantes dans les pays en développement (Psacharopoulos et Patrinos 2018), bien que l’incrément de l’enseignement secondaire a lenseignement supérieur soit assez important dans le cas de la Tunisie et contraste avec le manque de données dans les études antérieures sur la Tunisie en ce sens que les retombées économiques de |’éducation n’augmentent pas de facon monotone avec le niveau d’études (Limam et Ben Hafaiedh 2017 ; Zouari-Bouatour 1987 ; Zouari- Bouatour, Boudhraa et Zouari 2014). Entre 2012 et 2019, les retombées économiques de Venseignement primaire ont augmenté, tandis que ceux de l’enseignement supérieur ont diminué. Une tendance importante observée est que les retombées économiques de lenseignement supérieur ont diminué au fil du temps. En 2012, les retombées économiques de l’enseignement supérieur par rapport a l’enseignement secondaire étaient estimées a environ 33 % et ont progressivement diminué pour atteindre 26 % en 2019. La prime associée a\n\nVenseignement secondaire, qui s’ajoute a celle de\n\nNiveau d’emploi et de rémunération\n\nlenseignement primaire, a oscillé autour de 9 % au cours de la période. En revanche, les retombées économiques de l’enseignement primaire ont augmenté au fil du temps, passant de 9,6 % a 12,6 %. Cela semble correspondre a une offre croissante de personnes en Age de travailler ayant un dipl6éme universitaire qui ne s’accompagne pas d’une croissance aussi importante de la demande pour ce type de niveau d’études, en particulier dans le secteur privé. Une autre explication de la baisse des retombées économiques de l’enseignement supérieur concerne les changements dans la composition des emplois d’un groupe de diplomés a autre. Si offre de diplémés universitaires augmente et que la demande ne suit pas, certains diplémés seraient susceptibles de chercher des emplois exigeant un niveau de compétence inférieur a leurs qualifications, contribuant ainsi a une baisse des retombées économiques de |’enseignement supérieur. Marouani et Minh (2021) constatent que la part des emplois moyennement et faiblement qualifiés occupés par des travailleurs diplomés de l’enseignement supérieur a augmenté au détriment des emplois hautement qualifiés. Vhypothése d’une évolution technologique axée sur les compétences et d’une modification du contenu des taches des professions sous l’effet de la révolution des technologies de l’information pourrait alimenter cette explication. L’évolution technologique permet de remplacer les travailleurs effectuant des taches répétitives et peut également créer de nouvelles fonctions exigeant une combinaison de technologies et de travailleurs hautement qualifiés capables d’effectuer des taches abstraites. En Tunisie, ’employé moyen effectue moins de taches inter- personnelles et analytiques non routiniéres par rapport au salarié moyen en Allemagne (Banque mondiale 2021b). En 2017, Vintensité moyenne des taches routiniéres était inférieure au niveau observé en 2000, ce qui contraste avec les tendances observées dans les économies développées (Marouani et Minh 2021). Par rapport au secteur privé, les retombées économiques de l’enseignement supérieur sont environ trois fois plus élevées dans le secteur public, ot elles ont également augmenté au fil du temps. Les estimations montrent de grandes différences dans les retombées économiques de Péducation par heure travaillée entre les secteurs public et privé (). Les retombées de l’enseignement primaire ne sont pas trés différentes entre les deux secteurs. En 2019, les travailleurs ayant achevé leur scolarité primaire, en moyenne, environ 11 % de plus que les travailleurs jamais scolarisés, alors que, dans le secteur public, la prime a Penseignement primaire a été estimée a environ 13 %. Les retombées économiques de |’enseignement secondaire\n\nsont considérablement plus élevées dans le secteur public. En 2019, un salarié ayant suivi des études secondaires dans le secteur public a gagné environ 27 % de plus qu’un salarié ayant achevé leur scolarité primaire par heure travaillée, ce qui se compare a une prime d’environ 5,4 % dans le secteur privé. La prime a également augmenté au fil du temps dans le secteur public, passant de 20,8 % par rapport aux personnes ayant achevé leur scolarité primaire, en 2012. De méme, les retombées économiques de l’enseignement supérieur dans le secteur public étaient environ deux fois plus élevées par rapport au secteur privé en 2012, et cette prime a augmenté au fil du temps et elle était environ trois fois plus élevée en 2019, selon les estimations. Les salariés du secteur public ont bénéficié dune prime d’environ 46 % par rapport aux salariés ayant suivi des études secondaires par heure travaillée, contre environ 14,4 % dans le secteur privé. Des différences aussi importantes dans les retombées économiques de lenseignement supérieur contribuent probablement, avec la stabilité de ’emploi, la couverture sociale et d’autres avantages, a l’attrait des emplois du secteur public auprés\n\ndes diplémés universitaires. Les retombées économiques de |’éducation augmentent de fagon monotone avec le niveau d’études dans le secteur public. Le schéma identifié au niveau global, selon lequel les retombées économiques de |’éducation suivent une courbe en U, ne se vérifie pas dans les secteurs public et privé. Dans le secteur privé, la tendance détectée au niveau global est respectée, et l’avantage de l’enseignement secondaire par rapport au primaire est inférieur a l’avantage du primaire par rapport au fait de ne pas avoir fait d’études. En revanche, dans le secteur public, les retombées économiques de |’éducation augmentent avec le niveau d’études, ce qui est cohérent avec les résultats des études précédentes sur la Tunisie. En d’autres termes, les avantages d’avoir suivi une scolarité supplémentaire sont plus élevés au niveau de l’enseignement supérieur. Les retombées économiques de sont plus élevées chez les hommes que chez les femmes dans le secteur public. Dans le secteur public, les retombées économiques de l'éducation sont plus élevées pour les hommes que pour les femmes et l’écart augmente de fagon monotone avec le niveau de scolarité (Graphique 3.23). Par exemple, en 2019, les femmes diplomées de l’enseignement supérieur ont bénéficié d’une prime de 32,6 % par heure travaillée par rapport aux femmes ayant suivi des études secondaires. Dans le cas des hommes, la prime correspondante est estimée a environ 58,0 %, ce qui signifie un écart de prés de 26 points de pourcentage en faveur des hommes. De méme, les femmes ayant suivi des études secondaires ont bénéficié\n\n159\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nGRAPHIQUE 3.23.

Au fil du temps, la disparité entre les hommes et les femmes en\n\nmatiére de retombées économiques de |’éducation semble s’étre creusée.

Tout d’abord, le modéle en forme de U observé dans le secteur privé se maintient aussi bien chez les salariés formels que les informels a partir de 2019 (Graphique 3.24). Deuxiémement, on détecte une tendance différente entre les travailleurs formels et informels selon le sexe. Dans le cas des hommes, les retombées économiques de |’éducation sont plus élevées chez les travailleurs du secteur formel que chez ceux du secteur informel. Par exemple, en 2019, les retombées économiques de l’enseignement primaire par rapport au fait de n’avoir pas fait d’études se traduisaient en une différence d’environ 14,0 % par heure travaillée dans le cas d’un homme salarié du secteur formel et de 7,7 % dans le cas d’un homme travaillant dans le secteur informel. La différence est considérablement plus faible dans le cas de l’enseignement secondaire (0,9 point de pourcentage en faveur des travailleurs formels) et se creuse au niveau de l’enseignement supérieur (12,1 points de pourcentage en faveur des travailleurs formels). On détecte le schéma inverse chez les femmes, avec des retombées économiques de l'éducation plus élevées chez les travailleurs informels, sauf pour l’enseignement primaire. En outre, la différence dans le taux de rendement entre le formel et ’informel est plus faible dans le cas des femmes, a environ —0,5 point de pourcentage dans l’enseignement secondaire et a —4,8 points de pourcentage dans l’enseignement supérieur. Troisiémement, les retombées économiques de |’éducation sont plus élevées chez les hommes que chez les femmes, quel que soit le niveau de scolarité, a l’exception des travailleurs\n\ninformels dipl6més de l’enseignement supérieur. Parmi ces\n\nderniers, un écart d’environ 11,7 points de pourcentage est\n\nestimé en faveur des femmes. D’autres corrélations importantes dans les salaires horaires renvoient au secteur industriel, au grade professionnel, au type de contrat et a la situation géographique. Graphique 3.25 illustre les coefficients estimés d’une régression du logarithme du salaire horaire sur un ensemble de caractéristiques individuelles et professionnelles. Le secteur d’emploi a des effets considérables sur les salaires horaires lorsque l’on tient compte des variables du capital humain et d’une série de caractéristiques sur l’emploi. En 2019, par exemple, les écarts de salaires d’un secteur a autre atteignaient 39 % dans les services financiers, Passurance et l’immobilier, 31,5 % dans l’hébergement et la restauration, 28,8 % dans la construction, 25,7 % dans l’exploitation miniére et les carriéres, 25,7 % dans les transports, 23,6 % dans le commerce et 23,2 % dans Pindustrie manufacturiére. De méme, le type de profession des travailleurs a alimenté de grandes disparités dans les salaires horaires. Par rapport aux cadres, les spécialistes et techniciens et assimilés ont gagné prés de 29 % de plus par heure travaillée en 2019, tandis que les travailleurs employés dans toutes les autres professions ont gagné entre 16 % et 35 % de moins que les cadres par heure de travail. Par exemple, les travailleurs exercant des métiers élémentaires gagnaient environ 35 % de moins que les cadres, les opérateurs de machines environ 31 % de moins et les artisans environ 29 % de moins que les cadres.

La productivité est un moteur essentiel de la croissance et est indispensable a l’amélioration du niveau de vie par l’augmentation des revenus, en particulier chez les 40 % inférieurs, pour lesquels les revenus sont la principale source de revenus. La croissance de la productivité du travail peut étre obtenue de deux maniéres principales : (1) au sein des secteurs économiques, par l’accumulation de capital, les avancées technologiques ou l’amélioration de l’affectation des ressources entre les usines, et (2) par le déplacement de la main-d’ceuvre des secteurs a faible productivité vers les secteurs 4 plus forte productivité. A mesure que les économies se développent, la réaffectation de la main- d’ceuvre entre les secteurs, autrement dit la transformation structurelle, devient de moins en moins importante dans Paccroissement de la productivité du travail. La promotion de la croissance de la productivité est le principal canal et\n\nle principal moteur.”\n\nLe processus de transformation structurelle entraine un transfert de la main-d’ceuvre de l’agriculture vers le secteur secondaire et les services. Il s’accompagne également d’un processus de transformation spatiale, car les emplois dans Pindustrie manufacturiére et les services sont généralement concentrés dans les zones urbaines et alentour. Dans certains pays, cette évolution s’accompagne d’une urbanisation et d’une agglomération rapides, tandis que dans d’autres, le processus implique un déplacement spatial vers des villes secondaires. En Tunisie, l’avantage naturel que constitue Paccés au littoral de la Méditerranée et la proximité de lEurope, premier marché d’exportation de la Tunisie, a conduit a une concentration des activités économiques et de la population dans les zones cétiéres, en particulier dans les régions du Nord-Est et du Centre-Est, y compris le Grand Tunis. Selon la Banque mondiale (2014), plus de 92 % des entreprises industrielles se situent 4 moins d’une\n\nheure de route des villes de Tunis, Sfax et Sousse. Laugmentation de la productivité au sein des secteurs exige une transformation au niveau des entreprises, ce qui implique un passage a une production de biens et de\n\nservices plus sophistiquée et a plus forte valeur ajoutée,\n\nLes écarts de productivité abordés dans cette étude renvoient a la productivité moyenne. Toutefois, les écarts de productivité marginale sont importants et devraient diminuer 4 mesure que les économies se développent. La productivité marginale du travail est égale a la productivité moyenne, multipliée par la part des facteurs de production dans l’hypothése @une fonction de production Cobb-Douglas. Les comparaisons de la productivité moyenne du travail n’ont donc de sens qu’en l’absence de différences majeures dans les parts de travail entre les secteurs. Paysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nainsi qu’une transition des entreprises informelles en entreprises formelles. Les entreprises dynamiques et a forte croissance sont importantes pour la création d’emplois et la croissance de la productivité qui peuvent se traduire par des améliorations réparties du niveau de vie grace a des emplois de meilleure qualité. Pour cela, il faut un environnement commercial favorable, dans lequel la main-d’ceuvre et le capital sont affectés aux entreprises les plus productives et utilisés de la maniére la plus efficace, avec les meilleures technologies disponibles pour produire\n\ndes biens a forte valeur ajoutée. Ce chapitre évalue les canaux de création d’emplois en se concentrant sur deux transformations principales : (1) la transformation structurelle et spatiale, avec une analyse des variations dans les modéles des secteurs et de la situation géographique de l’emploi, et (2) la transformation du paysage des entreprises privées, avec une attention particuliére aux changements dans la structure des\n\nentreprises, la productivité et l’environnement des affaires. Transformation structurelle et spatiale\n\nAu cours de la décennie 2006-2017, le processus de transformation structurelle a suivi une progression lente. La transformation structurelle a progressé 4 un rythme légérement inférieur a la moyenne des autres pays a revenu intermédiaire.** En 2006, l’agriculture représentait 19,0 pour cent de l’emploi total ; cette part a diminué a 14,8 pour cent (-4,3 points) en 2017 (Graphique 4.1, panel b). Le déplacement de la main-d’ceuvre hors de Pagriculture s’est concentré sur la période 2006-11, avec la perte d’environ 63 000 emplois dans ce secteur. La main- d’ceuvre s’est déplacée vers les secteurs secondaires ainsi que vers le secteur des services, avec une accélération entre 2011 et 2017. La part d’emploi du secteur des services a augmenté de plus de 3 points de pourcentage sur la période 2006-17 pour atteindre 51,7 % en 2017. Les secteurs secondaires ont enregistré une hausse de leur part entre 2006 et 2011 et une légére baisse par la suite.

La construction, ainsi que l’agroalimentaire et la fabrication de produits mécaniques et électriques, ont été le moteur de la croissance de l’emploi dans les secteurs secondaires. Si le textile continue de contribuer a la plus grande part de Pemploi dans l’industrie manufacturiére, son importance relative a diminué. Entre 2006 et 2017, le secteur a perdu environ 25 000 travailleurs (Graphique 4.2 panel a). Il s’agit la de la conséquence a long terme de la fin des Accords multifibres de 1994, de l’adhésion de la Chine a POrganisation mondiale du commerce, de la montée en\n\npuissance de la Chine en tant que fabricant de produits\n\nd’exportation et des pressions exercées sur les exportations de produits de basse technologie d’autres pays. Cela souléve des questions quant aux emplois des femmes peu qualifiées, qui sont employées de maniére disproportionnée dans le secteur du textile. Le déclin de l’emploi dans le secteur du textile s’est toutefois ralenti depuis 2011 (Graphique 4.2 panel c). Parallélement, l’emploi dans l’agroalimentaire et la fabrication de produits mécaniques et électriques a augmenté, contribuant 4 87 000 emplois supplémentaires, soit plus de trois fois le nombre de travailleurs licenciés dans le secteur textile.

La construction a créé des emplois a un rythme rapide, et la part de l’emploi est passée de 12 % a 14 % entre 2006 et 2017, avec l’ajout d’environ 20 000 travailleurs par an. Le rythme de création d’emplois dans le secteur de la construction s’essoufflé depuis la révolution. Dans le secteur des services, la création d’emplois a été plus rapide dans les activités immobiliéres, le commerce et les transports. Au sein du secteur des services, le commerce et Padministration publique, ainsi que les services de santé et d’éducation, emploient la plus grande partie des travailleurs (voir Graphique 4.2, panel b). En 2017, la part de l'emploi dans le commerce était estimée 4 environ 13,2 %, et la part de Pemploi dans ’administration publique et les services de santé et d’éducation atteignait 19 %. Cependant, l’emploi a augmenté a un rythme plus rapide dans les services immobiliers, le commerce et les transports (Graphique 4.2 panel d) : une croissance cumulée de 65 % dans les services immobiliers et de plus de 34 % dans le commerce et les transports entre 2006 et 2017. A lui seul, le commerce a ajouté plus de 18 000 travailleurs par an, ce qui le place en deuxiéme position derriére le secteur de la construction. La transformation structurelle de l'économie s’est déroulée de maniére inégale d’une région a l’autre. Bien que le processus de transformation structurelle se soit poursuivi, en moyenne, a un rythme lent au cours de la décennie, certaines régions ont réalisé des progrés plus importants que d’autres. En particulier, les régions du Nord-Ouest et du Centre-Ouest, qui ont commencé avec une part plus\n\nimportante d’emplois agricoles en 2006, ont pu progresser plus rapidement que les autres dans la réaffectation de la main-d’ceuvre hors du secteur de l’agriculture (Graphique 4.4 panels a et b). Dans les deux régions, l’augmentation de la part de l’emploi non agricole a été plus importante dans le secteur des services que dans les secteurs secondaires. Lemploi dans le secteur des services est passé de 37,7 % a 43,1 % dans la région Nord-Ouest et de 36,9 % a 45,5 % dans la région Centre-Ouest. En 2017, le Grand Tunis, le Sud-Est et le Sud-Ouest composaient la plus grande part d’emplois dans le secteur des services, tandis que le Nord-Ouest et le Centre-Ouest avaient la plus grande part d’emplois agricoles, malgré les progrés réalisés au cours de la décennie. Une ventilation par secteur plus détaillée nous permet d’indiquer que la composition du secteur des services est quelque peu différente entre les trois zones présentant la plus grande part des services en 2017. Dans le Grand Tunis, les services bancaires et d’assurance, les activités immobiliéres et les services sociaux et culturels jouent un réle plus important que dans les régions du sud. Dans le Sud-Ouest, le secteur privé contribue nettement moins a !’emploi dans les services et la part de l’emploi dans Padministration publique, l’éducation et les services de santé est nettement plus importante (28,9 %) par rapport aux deux autres zones (Grand Tunis et Sud-Est). Lemploi dans le secteur des services est concentré dans le Grand Tunis et dans les régions cétiéres. Le Grand Tunis, comprenant les gouvernorats de |’Ariana, de Ben Arous, de la Manouba et de Tunis, contribue pour plus de 35 % a lemploi total du secteur des services, suivi du Centre-Est avec 22,4 % et du Nord-Est avec 12,7 % (Graphique 4.5). 170 Paysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nGRAPHIQUE 4.4, Distribution de l’emploi au niveau régional, par secteur, 2006 et 2017\n\na. 2006 b. 2017 Grand Tunis Grand Tunis Nord-est Nord-est Nord-ouest Nord-ouest Centre-est Centre-est\n\nCentre-ouest Centre-ouest\n\nSud-est Sud-est Sud-ouest Sud-ouest 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Pourcentage Pourcentage @ Agriculture Milndustrie ‘Ml Services B Agriculture MiIndustrie ‘ll Services\n\nSource : Sur la base des données tirées de |'Enquéte Nationale sur l’Emploi (ENPE), INS.

Création d’emplois : Transformation des secteurs, de l’espace et des entreprises\n\nDe méme, l’emploi dans l’industrie est considérable dans les régions cétiéres, principalement en raison des cofits de transport et de l’accés aux ports pour les exportations : 23,2 pour cent dans le Grand Tunis, 19,9 pour cent dans le Nord-Est et 32,3 pour cent dans le Centre-Est. En revanche, Pemploi agricole est concentré dans les régions intérieures, notamment dans le Nord-Ouest et le Centre-Ouest (22,8 % et 20,4 %, respectivement), bien qu’une part importante\n\nsoit située dans le Nord-Est. Au cours de la décennie, la création d’emplois s’est produite de maniére disproportionnée dans les régions cétiéres. Entre 2006 et 2017, le Grand Tunis a ajouté a lui seul plus de 220 000 personnes employées, soit prés de 50 % de tous les emplois générés dans le pays (Graphique 4.6 panel a). Le Nord-Est et le Centre-Est suivent avec environ 110 000 et 97 000 employés, respectivement, contribuant 4 24,4 % et 21,5 % du total des emplois créés entre 2006 et 2017. Le Nord-Ouest s’est distingué par une contribution négative a la croissance de l’emploi, avec une perte de plus de 36 000 emplois, tandis que le reste des régions a contribué entre 2 % et 6 % du total des emplois ajoutés entre 2006 et 2017. Ceci est évident dans les taux de croissance annualisés régionaux de l’emploi (Graphique 4.6 panel b). Le Grand Tunis et le Nord-Est ont affiché des taux de croissance de ’emploi de 2,5 % et 2 % par an, respectivement. Le Nord-Ouest a supprimé des emplois a un taux annuel de 0,9 %, et le Centre-Est a créé des emplois a un taux\n\nsimilaire a celui des régions du Sud. Les emplois salariés, en particulier ceux du secteur public et du secteur formel, sont également concentrés dans les zones cétiéres. Les emplois de haute qualité, y compris ceux du secteur public et les emplois salariés formels, sont concentrés dans le Grand Tunis et les régions cétiéres. La probabilité d’occuper différents types d’emplois est donc fortement corrélée a la région de résidence (Graphique 4.7 panels a et b). Les estimations tiennent compte des caractéristiques des travailleurs et indiquent que la probabilité d’étre employé en tant que salarié dans les secteurs non agricoles est plus élevée dans le Grand Tunis par rapport a toutes les autres régions, bien que les travailleurs du Nord-Est, du Centre-Est et du Sud-Est aient plus de chances d’étre employés en tant que salariés par rapport a leurs homologues des autres régions. Le travail dans l’agriculture, en tant que salarié ou indépendant, est plus fréquent dans les régions occidentales, de méme que la probabilité d’étre un travailleur familial collaborant a lentreprise familiale. Les emplois salariés formels du\n\nsecteur privé sont plus susceptibles d’apparaitre dans\n\nle Grand Tunis ; les travailleurs sont plus susceptibles d’étre employés dans le secteur public s’ils résident dans les régions du Nord-Ouest, du Centre-Ouest ou du Sud par rapport au Grand Tunis. Travailler dans un emploi non salarié ou comme employé informel est généralement plus probable en dehors du Grand Tunis (a l’exception du Nord-Est, du Nord-Ouest et du Sud-Ouest dans le cas des\n\nemployés informels). La concentration de l’emploi dans les régions cétiéres a contribué a faconner les modéles de migration interne. Selon la Banque mondiale (2021a), les tendances historiques de la migration interne persistent dans le temps, et les zones cétiéres de la Tunisie absorbent la plus grande partie des migrants. Les gouvernorats situés le long de la frontiére maritime orientale, dont Ariana (40 100), Ben Arous (26 600), Manouba (8 500), Medenine (2 700), Monastir (11 900), Nabeul (12 800), Sfax (9 600) et Sousse (19 200), ont eu un solde migratoire positif entre 2009 et 2014. Bien que le gouvernorat de Tunis ait connu un solde migratoire négatif, plus d’un migrant sur deux vivant a Tunis s’est déplacé vers les gouvernorats voisins qui font partie du Grand Tunis. Comme illustré dans le Tableau 4.1 les migrants se déplacent des régions de l’ouest et du sud vers le Grand Tunis, le nord-est et le centre-est (Banque mondiale 2021a). Le solde négatif le plus important est\n\ndétecté dans le Centre-Ouest, avec environ -44 400 entre 2009 et 2014. Des schémas géographiques similaires caractérisent le paysage des entreprises ; les entreprises enregistrées du secteur privé sont de plus en plus regroupées dans l’est de la Tunisie.*’ En 2003, le Grand Tunis et le Centre- Est représentaient plus de 55 % de toutes les entreprises enregistrées en Tunisie (Graphique 4.8). Le Nord-Est a suivi avec une part de 13,2 %, et toutes les autres régions ont contribué 4 moins de 10 % chacune, la part la plus faible étant celle du Sud-Ouest (4,7 %). Entre 2003 et 2019, le taux de croissance annualisé moyen du nombre d’entreprises enregistrées a été environ deux fois plus élevé dans le Grand Tunis et le Centre-Est, par rapport aux régions du Sud (Graphique 4.8). Par exemple, dans le Grand Tunis, le nombre d’entreprises enregistrées a augmenté a un taux d’environ 4,1 % par an, en moyenne,\n\ncontre environ 2 % dans le Nord-Ouest et le Sud-Ouest. °LINS tient un répertoire national des entreprises qui fournit une liste de toutes les entreprises du secteur privé enregistrées auprés de l’autorité fiscale, ainsi que le nombre de salariés enregistrés auprés de [’Institut national de sécurité sociale. 172 Paysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nGRAPHIQUE 4.6.

Par conséquent, plus de 15 ans plus tard, le paysage était encore plus regroupé sur le plan spatial. Plus de 60 % des entreprises enregistrées étaient situées dans le Grand Tunis et le Centre-Est. Le Nord-Est est resté stable avec une part d’environ 13 %. Toutes les\n\nautres régions ont enregistré une baisse de leur part. La densité des entreprises confirme la concentration géographique des entreprises enregistrées. Compte tenu des différences de taille de la population dans les zones géographiques, un indicateur capable de saisir la concentration des entreprises par rapport a la population résidant dans la méme zone permet de fournir un meilleur apercu du paysage des entreprises. La densité des entreprises\n\nenregistrées pour 1 000 personnes confirme que le nord\n\net lest de la Tunisie présentent la plus forte concentration d’entreprises enregistrées, les gouvernorats de Tunis (179), de l’Ariana (120), de Sousse (116), de Ben Arous (111) et de Sfax (110) étant en téte du classement en 2019 (Carte 4.1). En revanche, le Nord-Ouest et le Centre-Ouest sont a la traine, avec une moyenne d’environ 60 entreprises\n\nenregistrées pour 1 000 résidents. Les microentreprises et les grandes entreprises enregistrées sont regroupées le long du littoral nord-est de la Tunisie ; les microentreprises sont plus répandues dans les régions intérieures. Premiérement, le panorama des entreprises est dominé par les micro et petites entreprises (Carte 4.2 panels a et b).

Troisismement, dans le Nord-Est et le Centre-Est, le ratio entre les entreprises non micro et les micro- entreprises est plus élevé que dans le reste du pays. En 2019, on comptait environ 3,5 entreprises « non micro » pour 100 microentreprises, alors que, dans le reste du pays, le ratio se situait entre 1,1 et 1,7 pour 100.

Dans le secteur des services, il existe des différences d’une région a l’autre. En particulier, le Nord-Est abrite davantage de services 4 haute valeur ajoutée, notamment information et la communication, les activités financiéres et d’assurance, l’immobilier et les activités de services spécialisés, scientifiques et techniques. En revanche, le centre-est posséde un avantage comparatif dans l’industrie manufacturiére, et les autres régions accueillent des secteurs traditionnels, notamment le\n\ncommerce et les activités de transport. Le clivage entre les régions cétiéres et intérieures se traduit par des disparités de niveau de vie importantes qui persistent d’une région a l’autre, malgré des progrés considérables dans la réduction de la pauvreté. Un apercu des résultats en matiére de pauvreté au niveau des délégations est fourni a la Carte4.3 : les taux d’incidence de la pauvreté les plus élevés se trouvent dans les zones rurales de la Tunisie et dans les régions intérieures du pays, selon les estimations. Par exemple, en 2015, un taux de pauvreté de 53,5 % a été estimé a Hassi Ferid dans le Centre-Ouest, suivi par Djedeliane (53,1 %) et El Ayoun (50,1 %) dans la méme région. Les zones cétiéres présentaient, en moyenne, des taux d’incidence de la pauvreté plus faibles : 11,9 pour cent dans le Nord-Est et 11,7 pour cent dans le Centre-Est, bien que quelques poches de pauvreté soient présentes dans les\n\nzones rurales de ces régions. De méme, ces mémes régions\n\nprésentaient des taux de chomage plus faibles grace a une\n\nplus forte concentration des activités économiques. Transformation et productivité des entreprises\n\nLes microentreprises dominent le panorama des entreprises. Fournir un apergu complet des entreprises en activité en Tunisie n’est pas chose aisée.% En 2019, sur plus de 780 000 entreprises enregistrées auprés de l’administration fiscale, environ 87 % étaient des entreprises unipersonnelles, c’est-a-dire des travailleurs 4 leur compte ou des unités de microproduction sans employés formels. Dans l’ensemble, environ 97 % des entreprises enregistrées comptaient moins de 6 employés formels ; 2,3 % étaient des petites entreprises (entre 6 et 49 employés) ; 0,3 % étaient des entreprises de taille moyenne (entre 50 et 199 employés), et les 0,1 % restants étaient des entreprises comptant 200 employés formels ou plus. Vencadré 4.1 présente un profil des sociétés publiques. Sur la période 2003-19, la distribution des entreprises enregistrées n’a pas changé de maniére significative, bien qu’une augmentation de la part des microentreprises de 96,5 % en 2003 a 97,2 % en 2019 ait été enregistrée. Cela s’explique par la croissance rapide du nombre de travailleurs indépendants enregistrés, qui est passé d’environ 373 500 (85,2 %) en 2003 a plus de 679 700 (86,9 %) en 2019, ce qui peut s’expliquer en partie par le faible coat de l’enregistrement et les pénalités en cas de non-respect, en plus du régime fiscal spécial (régime forfaitaire) pour les microentreprises (Rijkers et coll. 2014).°! La part des petites, moyennes\n\net grandes entreprises a légérement diminué en raison\n\n© Le registre national des entreprises est une excellente source d’informations sur le nombre d’entreprises formelles en activité en Tunisie et sur le profil de la main-d’ceuvre formelle. Pourtant, aucune information n’est disponible sur le nombre d’unités de production informelles, y compris les petites entreprises non constituées en société et les entreprises familiales non enregistrées auprés de administration fiscale. Tous les cing ans, 'INS méne une enquéte sur les microentreprises en utilisant le registre des entreprises comme base de sondage. Venquéte porte sur les unités de production enregistrées auprés de l’'administration fiscale qui emploient moins de six travailleurs salariés et qui présentent un chiffre d’affaires annuel inférieur 4 un seuil déterminé (1 million de TD en 2016). Lenquéte fournit des informations sur le secteur informel, qui est défini comme l'ensemble des unités de production qui ne tiennent pas de comptabilité formelle, mais qui sont enregistrées auprés de Ladministration fiscale. Par ailleurs, l’enquéte trimestrielle sur la population active fournit des informations sur le nombre total de travailleurs dans le pays, y compris les employés formels et informels, les entreprises familiales formelles et informelles et les travailleurs 4 leur compte. La combinaison de ces sources d’information permet d’obtenir un apergu plus précis de la distribution des entreprises par taille. “ D'aprés Penquéte sur les microentreprises de 2016, environ 65 % des microentreprises non agricoles enregistrées ne tenaient pas de comptes formels. 176 Paysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nCARTE 4.1.

Sociétés publiques\n\nLes sociétés publiques sont une caractéristique essentielle des économies de la région MENA, et la Tunisie ne fait pas exception a la régle. Les sociétés publiques sont enracinées dans l’ensemble des sociétés héritées des régimes coloniaux et des politiques qui ont suivi au lendemain de I’indépendance (FMI 2021). Selon la Banque mondiale (2021 c), 195 sociétés publiques sont enregistrées dans les statistiques officielles, pour des revenus totaux en 2018 équivalant a environ 20 % du PIB et employant environ 190 000 travailleurs. Les sociétés publiques sont présentes dans 40 des 44 secteurs et sous-secteurs officiels, ce qui est bien supérieur a la moyenne des autres pays (entre 22 dans les économies développées et 26 dans les pays en développement). Les sociétés publiques opérent a la fois dans les secteurs des infrastructures et des autres secteurs, et le contrdle du gouvernement est souvent indirect. La plupart des grandes sociétés publiques tunisiennes sont fortement endettées et enregistrent des pertes. En 2018, 21 des 31 plus grandes sociétés publiques ont enregistré des pertes supérieures a 6 milliards de TD, soit 6 % du PIB. Les 10 autres ont réalisé des bénéfices et ont contribué a 88 et 75 pour cent de |’ensemble des revenus et des emplois des sociétés publiques, respectivement (Banque mondiale 2021c). En Tunisie, la plupart des sociétés publiques opérent dans des secteurs commerciaux (17 des 31 plus grandes sociétés publiques), bien qu'il n'y ait aucune justification économique a la propriété de |’Etat dans les secteurs commerciaux, par exemple |'industrie manufacturiére et la construction, car les marchés sont contestables et les entreprises privées peuvent fournir des biens ou des services plus efficacement.

Comme pour les entreprises onshore, les entreprises offshore sont principalement des microentreprises. Environ 87 % des entreprises offshore sont des microentreprises et 8,2 % sont des petites entreprises (Graphique 3.4 panel a). Les moyennes et grandes entreprises représentent environ 3,4 % et 1,3 % des unités de production du secteur offshore. Par rapport a la distribution des entreprises onshore, la part des entreprises offshore est plus importante dans la catégorie des moyennes et grandes entreprises. Plus de 86 % des employés formels du secteur offshore sont employés dans des grandes et moyennes entreprises, contre environ 54,7 % dans le secteur onshore (Graphique 3.4 panel b). Dans le but de faciliter l’intégration des entreprises en activité pour le marché intérieur et le marché d’exportation, le régime fiscal préférentiel pour le secteur offshore a été supprimé pour les entreprises nouvellement établies en janvier 2019 (Banque mondiale 2021c). En janvier 2021, la réforme a été étendue a toutes les entreprises offshore qui paient désormais entre 10 et 25 % d’impot sur les sociétés, avec des effets transitoires potentiellement négatifs sur la compétitivité et les marges bénéficiaires des entreprises offshore existantes (Banque mondiale 2021c). Les tendances récentes indiquent un approfondissement des modéles structurels dans les entreprises et la composition de l'emploi. Depuis 2011, les gains relatifs en matiére de création d’emplois des entreprises enregistrées se sont\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nproduits dans les extrémités de la distribution de la taille des entreprises. La part de l’emploi a augmenté de 1,7 point de pourcentage parmi les microentreprises et de 2,4 points de pourcentage parmi les grandes entreprises (Graphique 4.13). En revanche, les entreprises situées au milieu de la distribution des tailles ont affiché soit une contribution négative 4 la création d’emplois formels (—4,5 points de pourcentage dans le cas des entreprises moyennes), soit une modeste contribution positive dans le cas des petites entreprises (0,4 point de pourcentage). Ce sont les petites entreprises qui créent le plus d’emplois, mais cela est di a l’entrée de nouvelles entreprises, et la plupart d’entre elles sont petites. Des travaux antérieurs basés sur les données du registre des entreprises couvrant la période 1997-2010 indiquent que la création totale d’emplois a été en grande partie déterminée par |’entrée d’entreprises (Rijkers et coll. 2014). Pratiquement tous les nouveaux emplois nets ont été créés par les entreprises entrantes, et en particulier par des entreprises unipersonnelles, c’est- a-dire des travailleurs a leur compte. Aprés leur entrée, ces entreprises affichent une croissance modeste. Les données récentes du registre national des entreprises vont dans le méme sens : la part des entreprises entrantes est nettement plus importante parmi les microentreprises (moins de 6 employés formels) que parmi les petites, moyennes et grandes entreprises.

La mobilité des entreprises est limitée, et les petites entreprises sont plus susceptibles de fermer. La majorité des entreprises enregistrées ne se développent pas, méme sur le long terme (une période de 14 ans, 1997-2010). Par exemple, moins de 4 % et seulement 2 % de toutes les entreprises comptant entre 10 et 49 employés en 1996 employaient entre 50 et 99 ou plus de 100 travailleurs en 2010, respectivement (Rijkers et coll. 2014). Les tables de transition établies a partir des données du cycle 2020 des enquétes sur les entreprises confirment cette tendance.* Entre 2016 et 2020, la quasi-totalité des entreprises de taille moyenne et grande n’a pas connu de croissance, tandis que 1,2 % des petites entreprises ont réussi a se transformer en grandes entreprises. Si l’on considére la période écoulée depuis le début des activités de chaque entreprise, seul environ 1 % des petites entreprises sont devenues de grandes entreprises, alors qu’environ\n\n22 % des entreprises initialement petites ont franchi\n\nLes matrices relatives a la taille des structures au moment de l’enquéte sur les entreprises (2020) sont établies a l’aide de données précédentes, trois années fiscales auparavant (2016), et au moment de la création de l’entreprise.

Voir les Enquétes sur les entreprises (tableau de bord), Banque mondiale, Washington, DC, https:// www.enterprisesurveys.org/. le seuil pour devenir des entreprises de taille moyenne (Tableau 4.3). Les petites entreprises sont plus susceptibles de fermer. Entre 7 % et 8 % des entreprises de moins de six travailleurs quittent le marché aprés un an (en moyenne sur 1996-2010), contre 1,6 % a 3,8 % des moyennes et grandes entreprises (Rijkers et coll. 2014). De méme, sur une longue période, prés d’un travailleur indépendant enregistré auprés de l’administration fiscale sur 6 en 1996 a quitté le marché aprés 14 ans, contre moins de 20 % des entreprises de 1 000 employés ou plus (Rijkers et coll. 2014). Des données récentes confirment ces résultats : la part des entreprises qui sortent du marché est considérablement plus importante dans les entreprises de moins de six travailleurs que dans les entreprises plus grandes (voir Graphique 4.14, panel b). Le processus de « destruction créatrice » est faible, ce qui suggére la présence de distorsions. Des études antérieures\n\n“La taille de l’entreprise et son Age sont corrélés. C’est pourquoi des tables de transition distinctes par Age de l’entreprise (en 2016) permettraient de fournir des informations de bien meilleure qualité. Cependant, la petite taille de l’échantillon ne permet pas d’estimer des transitions statistiquement significatives par tranche d’Age. Les petites et jeunes entreprises (entre 1 et 9 ans en 2016) sont plus susceptibles de devenir des entreprises de taille moyenne (11,2 % ont fait la transition entre petite et moyenne taille en 2016-20) par rapport aux entreprises d’4ge moyen (1 % accomplit la méme transition) et aux entreprises plus anciennes (4,5 % deviennent des entreprises de taille moyenne). En 2016, les entreprises de taille moyenne ont eu tendance a maintenir leur taille, et seules quelques-unes, relativement peu nombreuses, sont parvenues a s’agrandir (respectivement 2 % et 3 % des entreprises de taille moyenne d’4ge moyen et plus anciennes). 183\n\nPaysage de l'emploi en Tunisie\n\nGRAPHIQUE 4.14.

La variation des prix peut étre décomposée en différences de prix des intrants, en différences de pouvoir de marché, et en différences de qualité et autres facteurs affectant la demande du produit. Ce qui suit se fonde sur la productivité basée sur les revenus et peut potentiellement méler la concentration croissante du marché et les gains d’efficacité. La PTF saisit la partie de la production qui n’est pas expliquée par la quantité facteurs de production utilisés (voir Francis et Karalashvili 2021).

Dans la mesure out ces différences sont attribuables aux rentes d’entreprise, l’analyse plaide en faveur d’une réaffectation de la main- @ceuvre vers les secteurs les plus concentrés et les plus faussés de l'économie, par opposition aux secteurs les plus productifs. La valeur ajoutée par travailleur et la PTF ne sont calculées que pour les entreprises manufacturiéres, alors que les ventes par travailleur sont une mesure disponible pour toutes les entreprises visées dans l’enquéte.

Les plus fortes réductions de trésorerie signalées par les entreprises ont été observées dans les secteurs de ’hébergement et de la restauration, des transports et de l’entreposage, ainsi que de la fabrication d’articles mécaniques et électriques. En outre, l’environnement des entreprises s’est détérioré ; une part croissante d’entre elles font état d’obstacles majeurs ou graves dans leur exploitation au quotidien. Les entreprises saisies dans le cycle 2019 de l’enquéte sur les entreprises signalent, en moyenne, une détérioration de Penvironnement des affaires dans toutes les composantes, a lexception de l’instabilité politique, ce qui n’est pas surprenant si l’on considére que le cycle d’enquéte précédent (2013) a été mené au lendemain de la révolution de 2011 (Graphique 4.18). LVaugmentation de la part des entreprises déclarant que les contraintes suivantes sont majeures ou graves est particuliérement frappante : transport (+37 points de pourcentage), concurrence du secteur informel (+30 points de pourcentage), licences et permis d’exploitation (+23,5 points de pourcentage), réglementations douaniéres et commerciales (+23,6 points de pourcentage), accés au financement (+23,4 points de pourcentage) et électricité (+23,3 points de pourcentage). Les trois principaux obstacles en 2020 étaient la con- currence du secteur informel, la corruption et l’instabilité politique. Plus d’une entreprise sur deux a mentionné chacun de ces problémes comme des obstacles graves ou\n\nmajeurs.

La part des entreprises ayant investi dans le capital physique au cours de l’exercice précédent Penquéte a diminué de 44 % a 31 % entre 2013 et 2020 ; de méme, la part des entreprises proposant une formation formelle aux travailleurs s’est contractée de 10 points et était estimée a environ 19 % en 2020 (Graphique 4.19).

As one of the youngest populations in the world, it is imperative that adequate investments are made in education and learning that holds value in the labour market and prepares citizens for the world of tomorrow. In addition, as the global transformation of work unfolds in Africa, policymakers, business leaders and workers must bve prepared to proactively manage this period of transition. At the World Economic Forum, we seek to support leaders and the public by sharing the latest insights on the changes underway. This Executive Briefing on the Future of Jobs and Skills in Africa uses the latest available data, including through a research partnership with LinkedIn, to provide a concise overview of the region’s education, skills and jobs agenda. In addition to providing insights on current trends and future projections, the World Economic Forum also aims to provide a platform for multistakeholder collaboration\n\nto close skills gaps and prepare for the future of work. The Africa Skills Initiative serves as such a platform, consolidating the latest insights, bringing together different businesses’ efforts to address future-oriented skills development and supporting constructive public-private dialogue for urgent and fundamental reform of education systems and labour policies to prepare workforces for the future of jobs. This Executive Briefing is intended as a practical guide for leaders from business, government, civil society and the education sector to plan for the needs of the future, including those involved in the Africa Skills Initiative. It is also a call to action to the region’s leaders to address urgently the reforms that are needed today to ensure that Africa’s young people can harness the new opportunities that are coming their way. The Future of Jobs and Skills in Africa | i\n\nKey Findings\n\nThe World Economic Forum’s Human Capital Index finds that Sub-Saharan Africa currently only captures 55% of its human capital potential, compared to a global average of 65%. With more than 60% of its population under the age of 25, Sub-Saharan Africa is the world’s youngest region. By 2030, the continent’s working-age population is set to increase by two-thirds, from 370 million adults in 2010 to over 600 million in 2030. The share of this population with at least a secondary education is set to increase from 36% in 2010 to 52% in 2030. As 15 to 20 million increasingly well-educated young people are expected to join the African workforce every year for the next three decades, delivering the ecosystem for quality jobs — and future skills to match — will be imperative for fully leveraging the continent’s demographic dividend. While it is predicted that 41% of all work activities in South Africa are susceptible to automation, as are 44% in Ethiopia, 46% in Nigeria and 52% in Kenya; this is likely moderated by comparatively low labour costs and offset by new job creation. Despite this longer window of opportunity, the region’s capacity to adapt to further job disruption is a concern, although there are important nuances at the country level. Employers across the region already identify inadequately skilled workforces as a major constraint to their businesses, including 41% of all firms in Tanzania, 30% in Kenya, 9% in South Africa and 6% in Nigeria. This pattern may get worse in the future. In South Africa alone, 39% of core skills required across occupations will be wholly different by 2020. ¢ Often this skills instability stems from the fact that many jobs in the region are becoming more intense in their use of digital technologies. Average ICT intensity of jobs in South Africa increased by 26% over the last decade, while 6.7% of all formal sector employment in Ghana and 18.4% of all formal sector employment in Kenya occurs in occupations with high ICT intensity. Currently trending professions on the continent include the creative industries, food technologists, 3D designers, data centre workers and care, education and health workers, according to our analysis in partnership with LinkedIn. In the longer term, there is strong job growth potential in hard and soft infrastructure, green jobs, the ICT sector and through new work formats. The greatest long-term benefits of ICT intensive jobs in the region are likely to be not in the lower-skilled delivery of digital products or services but in digital design, creation and engineering. To build a pipeline of future skills, Africa's educators should design future-ready curricula that encourage critical thinking, creativity and emotional intelligence as well as accelerate acquisition of digital\n\nand STEM skills to match the way people will work and collaborate in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The Forum’s Africa Skills Initiative provides relevant new insights, brings together different businesses’ efforts to address future-oriented skills development and supports constructive public-private dialogue for urgent and fundamental reform of education systems and labour policies to prepare workforces for the future of jobs.

With more than 60% of its population under the age of\n\n25, Sub-Saharan Africa is already the world’s youngest region today — and, by 2030, will be home to more than one-quarter of the world’s total under-25 population. Over this period, the region is projected to expand the size of its workforce by more than the rest of the world combined,’ as its young population, the best-educated and globally connected the continent has ever had, enters the world of work. By leveraging this demographic opportunity, Sub-\n\nSaharan Africa has the potential to unleash new economic possibilities created by future industries and labour markets, dramatically raising labour productivity and per capita incomes, diversifying its economy, and becoming an engine for stable economic growth, high-skilled talent and job creation for decades to come. Today, however, Sub-Saharan Africa is far removed from making optimal use of its human capital potential and under-prepared for the impending disruption to jobs and skills brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution.” The World Economic Forum’s Human Capital Index, which measures the extent to which countries and economies optimize their human capital through education and skills development and its deployment throughout the life-course, finds that Sub-Saharan Africa, on average, currently only captures 55% of its full human capital potential, compared to a global average of 65%, ranging from 67 to 63% in Mauritius, Ghana and South Africa to only 49 to 44% in Mali, Nigeria and Chad (Figure 2).°\n\nFigure 1: Sub-Saharan Africa’s demographic structure\n\nDemographic structure\n\n65 and over a 55064 S 2 D 25 to 54 © D < 15 to 24 under 15 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 Share of total population (%) HH Male i Female\n\nPopulation distribution by age\n\nWorld\n\nSub- wee | i Africa\n\n20 40 60 80 100 Share of total population (%)\n\n°\n\nMM under 25 25-54 I 55 and over\n\nSource: United Nations Population Division.

However, more significant workforce participation gender gaps remain in countries such as Mauritius, Mali, Cote d’lvoire and Nigeria (Figure 5). While the region’s rapid economic growth, dynamic young population and high labour force participation hold much promise, challenges remain when it comes to the creation of quality, formal sector jobs. On average, Sub-Saharan Africa exhibits a high-skilled employment share of just 6%, a contrast to the global average of 24%.

Countries such as South Africa, Mauritius and Botswana lead the way\n\nin the local availability of high-skilled jobs while others, such as Ethiopia and Nigeria, maintain large proportions of workers in lower-skilled jobs (Figure 6).

While formal sector employment did grow in Sub-Saharan Africa over the past two decades, this job growth has simply not kept pace with population growth, resulting in fewer opportunities in the formal labour market for the increasing numbers of Africa’s young school and university graduates. Where Africans are employed in the formal sector, this employment tends to be in smaller-sized firms with limited resources to invest in upskilling and reskilling opportunities (Figure 7). In addition, a sizeable number of Africans continue to work in the informal economy,\n\nFigure 8: Share of African employers perceiving inadequate workforce skills as major constraint\n\nChad Mauritius Mali Gabon Tanzania Burkina Faso Céte d'Ivoire Botswana Kenya Rwanda Benin Cameroon Mozambique [Ei Lesotho [a Ghana (Ea Guinea EE Uganda (Za Zambia Malawi Madagascar Senegal EN Burundi Ei South Africa EI Nigeria Ethiopia Namibia\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 Share of employers (%)\n\nSource: World Bank Enterprise Surveys. Executive Briefing\n\non family farms and in urban self-employment — usually sectors where the skills of the newly secondary or tertiary educated are least value-adding and, particularly in rural areas, where they often least aspire to work.® This limited success in capitalizing on its existing education investment to date goes to the heart of the region’s relatively poor performance on the Forum’s Human Capital Index\n\n(Figure 2). At the same time, large numbers of African employers are citing inadequately skilled workforces as a major constraint to business expansion (Figure 8). This points to a double bind. In addition to the mismatch between the number of educated young people seeking jobs and the availability of formal, high-quality jobs, there is the added constraint of young people being inadequately prepared for such roles. Closer dialogue between education providers and industry is needed to align and optimize the region’s demand and supply of skills. Additionally, the continent’s employers and educators need better tools to enable them to better understand labour markets’ new and emerging skills requirements. Closing Africa’s data gap to close its skills gap\n\nReliable and timely data on the structure of employment and skills in Sub-Saharan Africa is difficult to obtain. There is scarce information on the number of existing jobs, of newly created jobs, and of unfilled vacancies in specific sectors, undermining efforts to systematically assess\n\nand develop the continent’s skills base.’ To produce\n\nthis Executive Briefing, a wide range of traditional and innovative data sources were consulted to provide the most complete picture possible. Nevertheless, initiatives aimed at closing skills gaps can only be so effective if they are hampered by parallel data gaps. To maximize opportunities to build future skills, initiatives aimed directly at improving\n\ndata collection—including on work in the region’s informal sector®—are also needed. This need not mean simply copying methods used in other countries.° Instead, African governments, with the help of private sector stakeholders, have an opportunity to develop tailored approaches\n\nto understanding the region’s evolving skills base and emerging jobs scenarios. Limited data also hinders deeper understanding of gender gaps across the region, as many African economies lack data on progression of women across higher-skilled and senior roles, making it hard to gain a more nuanced understanding of both halves of the region’s talent.

In countries such as Nigeria, Botswana, Benin, Uganda, Malawi and Mozambique the contrast in the education levels of older and younger generations is particularly striking. The combined effects of rising post-basic education attainment and the large proportion of young people across the region present Sub-Saharan Africa with a unique demographic opportunity. If current demographic and education trends continue, the continent’s working- age population is set to increase by two-thirds by 2030, from 370 million adults in 2010 to over 600 million in 2030, while the share of this population with at least a secondary education is set to increase from 36% in 2010 to 52% in 2030 (Figure 11).

Executive Briefing\n\nThis progress, while setting up more people than ever before for building their future livelihoods, still leaves a very significant portion of the population behind on education,\n\na deficit that will last for decades across multiple generations. The overall expansion in education also masks disparities and uneven outcomes across various segments of the education system. There is currently a lack of upstream and downstream coordination between Africa’s primary, secondary and tertiary education providers and the region’s pre-primary, technical and vocational, adult training and non-formal education systems remain unevenly developed. In addition, Sub-Saharan Africa retains the largest gender gap in the education of girls and boys of any world region, limiting the breadth of Sub-Saharan Africa’s available talent pool and furthering social and economic disparities between women and men later in life.'2\n\nFigure 12: Quality of Africa’s education systems\n\nWorld average: 3.8\n\nKenya _ vere Mauritius eC Cra 2s che Lesotho Sotsvero Cameroon Senegal _ ions Uganda SC nis hei ei ei Madagascar _ Cabo Nigeria a Mozambique ud Che Benin South rice Mauritania\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Quality rating, 1-7 (best)\n\nSource: World Economic Forum, Executive Opinion Survey. The Future of Jobs and Skills in Africa | 7\n\nExecutive Briefing\n\nFor those who are enrolled in schools and universities, African education systems’ quality and ability to meet\n\nthe needs of a competitive economy, as perceived by respondents to the World Economic Forum’s Executive Opinion Survey, remain a concern. They rank significantly below the global average—suggesting that learners\n\nare not acquiring the knowledge and skills required for today’s economies and societies (Figure 12). This is further corroborated by business leaders’ concerns about the difficulty of finding skilled workers for their businesses. Finally, for those who are a part of the continent's high-skilled white collar workforce (Figure 13), the data reveals that 35% of LinkedIn's tertiary-educated African members hold Business, Administration and Law degrees—dominated by specialization in accounting\n\nand complemented by qualifications in law, business management, banking, finance, marketing and human resources. The data also suggests the availability of a fairly large science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) talent pool, comprising nearly 40% of the LinkedIn sample and split between specialization in Engineering, Manufacturing and Construction (16%), Information and Communication Technologies (11%), and Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics (11%). Within Engineering, Manufacturing and Construction, more than half of graduates have focused on electrical, civil, mechanical or chemical engineering, or architecture and urban design. Among those with an ICT qualification, the large majority are specialized in either computer science or in developing and maintaining information systems and databases. A much smaller cohort of African professionals have studied hardware and software engineering and only a select few have focused on artificial intelligence. Among those who have specialised in Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics, more than half have studied basic sciences such as biology, chemistry or mathematics, while more than one in six have focused on applied fields such as biochemistry, bioinformatics, neuroscience or environmental science. 8 | The Future of Jobs and Skills in Africa\n\nFigure 13: Distribution of fields of study among Africa's tertiary-educated workforce\n\nHealth and welfare, 4% Arts and humanities, 5% |\n\nNatural sciences, mathematics and statistics, 11%\n\nBusiness, administration and law, 35%\n\nInformation and communication technologies, 11%\n\nSocial sciences, journalism and information, 13%\n\nEngineering, manufacturing and construction, 16%\n\nSource: Linkedin\n\nThe future of jobs\n\nAn estimated 15 to 20 million increasingly well-educated young people are expected to join the African workforce every year for the next three decades. Delivering the quality jobs to match in order to fully leverage the continent’s demographic opportunity is set to be one of Sub-Saharan Africa’s defining challenges over the coming years. Simultaneously, the Fourth Industrial Revolution will interact with a range of additional socio-economic and demographic factors affecting the region, resulting in major disruptions to labour markets, growth in wholly new occupations, new ways of organizing and coordinating work, new skills requirements in all jobs and new tools to augment workers’ capabilities (Figure 14). Sub-Saharan Africa stands at a crossroads regarding its future development path, with a range of opportunities to invest in its skills base, leveraging existing strengths\n\nto increase local value-add across a broad range of industries. Investment in specialist skills and local talent in the building and construction trades due to rapid urbanization and a continent-wide need for infrastructure development is one obvious example. Additional demand for specialist skills and local talent in consumer industries such as agriculture, food and beverages, home and\n\npersonal care, apparel and transport and automotive, expanding rapidly due to the region’s growing population, is another.'8 As the Fourth Industrial Revolution unfolds, Sub-Saharan Africa is also poised to develop new business models on the basis of these technologies.\"4 Innovations such as mobile payments systems like M-Pesa in financial services, the use of drones for last mile delivery in transportation and logistics and the development of a wide range of digital applications tailored to Africa’s continued importance and unique strengths in agriculture point to the growth of these new aspects in the region’s economy.'®\n\nWhat is likely to be the jobs impact of these changes? Much as in more economically advanced world regions, concerns have recently been raised regarding the potential impact of automation on jobs on the continent. It has been estimated that, from a technological standpoint,\n\n41% of all work activities in South Africa are susceptible to automation, as are 44% in Ethiopia, 46% in Nigeria, 48% in Mauritius, 52% in Kenya and 53% in Angola.'® However, these effects are likely to be moderated by comparatively lower wages and slower technology adoption. Executive Briefing\n\nIn addition, whether jobs are declining, stable or growing, they are going through major changes to their skills profile. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs analysis found that, just in South Africa alone, 39% of core skills required across all occupations will be different by 2020 as compared to what was needed to perform those roles in 2015.\"\n\nAt the same time, across the continent, substantial potential exists for creating high value-adding formal sector jobs in a number of areas. While the Fourth Industrial Revolution may be disruptive\n\nto many occupations, it is also projected to create a wide range of new jobs in fields such as STEM, data analysis, computer science and engineering. There will be strong demand for professionals who can blend digital and\n\nSTEM skills with traditional subject expertise, such as digital-mechanical engineers and business operations data analysts, who combine deep knowledge of their industry with the latest analytical tools to quickly adapt business strategies. There will also be more demand for user interface experts, who can facilitate seamless human- machine interaction.'® For Sub-Saharan Africa, the greatest long-term benefits of such jobs are likely to be found in\n\nthe promotion of home-grown African digital creators, designers and makers, not just digital deliverers.'?

Investment in Sub-Saharan Africa’s enormous infrastructure needs, such as improvements in the continent’s transport networks,\n\nis booming. While the potential benefits of such “hard” infrastructure investments are well-recognized, economists predict equivalent or greater — often untapped — job creation potential of investments in countries’ “soft” infrastructure of childcare, eldercare and education, which also often produce more gender-balanced labour market outcomes. For example, the direct and indirect job creation effects of an investment of 2% of GDP in South Africa would amount to 511,000 jobs in construction (with 29.6% of direct jobs going to women) and 414,000 jobs in care (with 61.4% of direct jobs going to women).”° Investing\n\nin the care economy also dovetails with the recognized importance of early-childhood education for human capital development. In addition, millions of new teachers will also be needed across the continent.?! The transition to a more ecologically sustainable economic model also has the potential to create millions of new jobs globally, including in Sub-Saharan Africa. For example, it\n\nis estimated that by 2025 South Africa alone could create 462,000 additional jobs by “going green”, including in clean energy generation, energy efficiency, pollution control and natural resource management. Similar estimates exist for countries such as Mauritius, Namibia, Kenya, Senegal, Uganda and Zambia.22\n\nFinally, regardless of sector or occupation, new work formats are offering individuals and entrepreneurs new opportunities. Online platform work is on the rise globally, including in Sub-Saharan Africa. For example, the continent currently has 56 e-ridesharing services, most of them homegrown apps launched over the last three years.?8 In Africa, online talent platforms have the potential to create significant benefits by moving people from informal to formal jobs, by increasing workforce participation and hours worked of those formerly underemployed or inactive, by shortening the duration of job searches and by enabling matches that would otherwise not have happened.2*\n\nBy 2025, this could result in 536,000 additional full-time equivalent jobs and a US$3bn increase in GDP in Kenya, 861,000 jobs and US$20bn in South Africa, and 1.9\n\nmillion jobs and US$20bn additional GDP in Nigeria.25\n\nAs elsewhere, African companies will increasingly need\n\nto learn to manage a distributed, virtual workforce, to integrate virtual freelance workers and to mitigate the challenges engaging in online work. 10 | The Future of Jobs and Skills in Africa\n\nFuture-ready strategies\n\nThe current spread of education and skills across generations and the expected future trajectory of jobs point to particular strategies for the region to ensure that it is prepared for the labour markets of the future. Recent World Economic Forum research on Realizing Human Potential in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, developed through in-depth consultation with leading experts and practitioners, recommends a number of levers for creating stronger education systems, including: 1) expanded access to early-childhood education; 2) ensuring the ‘future-readiness’ of curricula; 3) investing in developing and maintaining a professionalized teaching workforce; 4) early exposure to the workplace and career guidance; 5) investing in digital fluency and ICT literacy skills; 6) providing robust and respected technical and vocational education and training (TVET); 7) creating a culture of lifelong learning; and 8) openness to education innovation.2°\n\nAll eight areas apply to the region and it must ensure that access is universal, leadership of reforms is drawn from multiple sectors and that new education systems are designed for the long-term, while maintain agility to cope with the constant pace of change. This section highlights four particular areas for strategic focus: ensuring the ‘future-readiness’ of curricula, especially through a focus on STEM fields; investing in digital fluency and ICT literacy skills; providing robust and respected technical and vocational education and training (TVET); and creating a culture of lifelong learning including the provision of adult training and upskilling infrastructure. Providing robust and respected technical and vocational education and training (TVET)\n\nCurrently, economies across Sub-Saharan Africa have not fully leveraged the opportunities offered by TVET, with formal enrolment standing at only 6% of total secondary and post-secondary enrolment across the region.?’ In parallel to improving the job-relevance of formal TVET instruction, support should also be given to upgrading Africa’s more widespread practice of offering informal apprenticeships.*° However, the latter may often present fewer opportunities to update curricula with new practices through strategic corporate initiatives and a balance must be found between formal and informal approaches.?°\n\nCreating a culture of lifelong learning\n\nWhile the bulk of Africa’s population is very young, for those cohorts that are already part of the workforce, there is a need for both a culture of lifelong learning as well\n\nas the infrastructure that can help make such continued learning and training feasible. This is particularly necessary due to the rapid technological developments taking place in the global labour market and Sub-Saharan Africa’s uneven provision of formal education to date. The continent will particularly benefit from the provision of lifelong learning opportunities that provide support for reskilling and upskilling and a shift towards a more holistic approach for encouraging and recognizing skills acquisition across all types of training. More learning will need to take place in the workplace and greater private sector involvement holds the key to building more resilient talent pools in\n\nthe region. Africa’s employers should therefore offer learning opportunities to their workers, in collaboration with governments, schools, universities and non-formal\n\neducation providers. Continental and sub-regional harmonization of curriculum design and skills recognition will make these efforts more efficient and fruitful, for companies and workers alike. Ensuring the ‘future-readiness’ of curricula\n\nFor an optimistic vision of the future of jobs in Sub-Saharan Africa to become a reality, investment in human capital must aim not just to develop the skills needed today, but also to start building the skills needed to successfully leverage the technological advances of tomorrow. To\n\ndevelop this pipeline of future skills, Africa’s educators should begin by encouraging critical thinking, creativity, cognitive flexibility and emotional intelligence, as opposed to rote learning, to match the way people will increasingly work and collaborate in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. A particular strategic focus for the region should entail updating the quality of science, technology, engineering and mathematics education at the secondary level and through technical and vocational and tertiary education to develop a workforce capable of competing in technology- driven economies. Currently, African college graduates with a STEM degree represent a mere two percent of\n\nthe continent’s total university-age population®® but are increasingly needed across a wide variety of industries. Not everyone needs to become an engineer or a data scientist but, as African employers expect to have many thousands of job openings requiring basic and more advanced STEM literacy, much is to be gained by increasing African workforces’ overall future-readiness in this field.°' As in more advanced economies, special attention should also be given to encouraging female STEM talent, as currently, for example, only 17% of students pursuing degrees in science and technology subjects in Kenya are women,\n\nExecutive Briefing\n\nas are 24% in Tanzania, 18% in Uganda and 27% in Rwanda.°2\n\nInvesting in digital fluency and ICT literacy skills\n\nDeveloping and implementing ‘future-proof’ basic and vocational curricula includes digital fluency and ICT literacy skills, which it is important to highlight as a particularly high value investment for the future. Emerging jobs around the world and across all skill levels are becoming more intensive in their use of digital technologies, including in Sub-Saharan Africa. According to estimates by the World Bank, the average ICT intensity of jobs in South Africa increased by 26% over the last decade, while 6.7% of all employment in Ghana and 18.4% of all employment in Kenya occurs in occupations with high ICT intensity.°$ In addition, a number of African countries have successfully positioned themselves as hubs for the global digital business process outsourcing (BPO) sector, including Ghana, Mauritius, Kenya, Senegal and South Africa. For example, more than 210,000 South Africans and roughly 7,000 Kenyans currently work in BPO, mostly in voice- based services and transactional back-office services.°4 However, the greatest long-term benefits of ICT intensive jobs would be unlocked by equipping Africans with the skills to design and engineer home-grown solutions rather than simply servicing the lower-skilled delivery end of the global digital market.°°\n\nFinally, improving labour market data and forecasts is in itself a tool for designing better and more nuanced future- ready strategies, focused on specific skills, geographies or sectors. The Future of Jobs and Skills in Africa | 11\n\nExecutive Briefing\n\nDynamic data for decision-making\n\nA nuanced view on the current deployment of educational specializations across key industries, rather than assumptions based on past patterns, is critical to understanding the extent to which particular industries\n\nand degrees are tied in today’s labour market. This is particularly important for identifying and engaging industry stakeholders in the co-development and refurbishing\n\nof relevant degree curricula. We provide one such view below through our research partnership with LinkedIn, indicating the pattern of co-occurrence between degrees and industries, which suggests that some fields of study have particularly close relationships to certain industries, while others feed more broadly into Africa’s labour market (Figure 15, 16 and 17). For example, despite particular concentrations of Engineering, Manufacturing and Construction specializations in the architecture, engineering and energy sectors and of ICT specializations in the software industry, strong demand for STEM and ICT skills exists across a wide range of Africa’s industries (Figure 15). A second promising approach for policymakers, businesses, educators and workers to understand the unfolding employment landscape consists of tracking the growing\n\nand declining share of specific job functions and particular professions on the basis of data from professional networking sites and online job adverts. We provide\n\none such picture for Africa below through our research partnership with LinkedIn, indicating growing shares of job functions broadly in the fields of business development, education, entrepreneurship, media and communications and marketing, among others (Figure 18). Reviewing the detailed matching data for particular professions reveals upward trends in professions such as the creative industries, food technologists, 3D designers, data centre workers and care, education and health workers (Figure 19). Such data, while limited to those who have digital access and often available for the high- and medium-skilled white collar workforce only, holds strong potential over time\n\nfor improving forecasts and planning for specific skills, occupations, sectors and geographies.

While a large cluster of African countries (the lower left quadrant of Figure 20) currently have a comparatively low capacity to adapt to the requirements of future jobs, their relative exposure to these trends, at least for now, is also still somewhat limited. These economies have a window of opportunity for engaging in long-delayed reforms and their efforts should particularly focus on strengthening basic education as well as building a strong TVET system to lay a good foundation for the future. A second group of countries—including Kenya and South Africa—have a somewhat higher capacity to adapt but are also more immediately exposed to the job disruptions of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In these countries, urgent reskilling and upskilling efforts are needed, focusing in particular on strengthening higher education and adult learning. Executive Briefing\n\nFinally, a number of African countries, including Ghana, Rwanda and Mauritius, have a relatively high capacity to adapt to the requirements of future jobs and are comparatively well-positioned to prepare themselves, with relatively low exposure at present — but here, too, there is no room for complacency, and efforts to embed a culture of lifelong learning and continuous upskilling are needed. The region urgently needs to make the right investment decisions today to strengthen the continent’s foundations for the jobs and skills of tomorrow. Africa’s CEOs cite insufficient understanding of the disruptive changes underway as the single biggest obstacle to future workforce planning, followed by resource constraints and insufficient alignment of firms’ talent strategies with their broader innovation strategies.° Collaboration between business and the education sector is also limited. In addition there is relatively little collaboration among the firms that are seeking to address skills gaps in their own workforces as well as the communities around them, resulting in uncoordinated, potentially wasteful, efforts.

There is the fascination of watching a figment\n\nof the imagination emerge through the aid of science to a plan on paper. Then it brings jobs and homes...it elevates the standards of living and adds to the comforts of life. That is the engineer's high privilege. —Herbert Hoover, engineer, humanitarian, and 31° U.S. President\n\nA diverse group of civil engineering and other leaders, including international guests, gathered in June 2006 to actively participate in the Summit on the Future of Civil Engineering. Their purpose: articulate an aspirational global vision for the future of civil engineering addressing all levels and facets of the civil engineering community. Today’s status of civil engineering served as the Summit’s benchmark. Examples of current issues and trends noted at the Summit include the poor condition of the infrastructure in many nations, the occurrence of corruption in the global engineering and construction industry, the minimal involvement of civil engineers in the political process, the need to more fully embrace sustainability, the globalization of engineering practice, and the desire to attract the best and brightest to the profession. Summit participants see a very different world for civil engineers in 2025. An ever-increasing global population that continues to shift to urban areas will require widespread adoption of sustainability. Demands for energy, drinking water, clean air, safe waste disposal, and transportation will drive environmental protection and infrastructure development. Society will face increased threats from natural events, accidents, and perhaps other causes such as terrorism. Dealing with the preceding problems and opportunities will require intra-disciplinary, cross-disciplinary, and multi- disciplinary collaboration on projects and in research and\n\nCivil engineering leaders gathered in June 2006 to articulate a global vision for civil engineering. The civil engineer’s world of 2025\n\nwill be even more challenging than today. In 2025, civil engineers will serve as master builders, environmental stewards, innovators and integrators, managers of risk and uncertainty, and leaders in shaping public policy. Leaders of civil engineering organizations around the globe should move the civil engineering community toward the vision. development. More advances in areas such as information technology, intelligent infrastructure, and digital simulation will be needed. Informed by this state of the civil engineering profession and the challenges and opportunities facing it, the aspirational global vision developed as a result of the Summit is:\n\nEntrusted by society to create a sustainable world and enhance the global quality of life, civil engineers serve competently, collaboratively, and ethically as master:\n\ne planners, designers, constructors, and operators of society’s economic and social engine—the built environment;\n\ne stewards of the natural environment and its resources;\n\ne innovators and integrators of ideas and technology across the public, private, and academic sectors;\n\ne managers of risk and uncertainty caused by natural events, accidents, and other threats; and\n\ne leaders in discussions and decisions shaping public environmental and infrastructure policy. Summit organizers and participants want this vision to guide policies, plans, processes, and progress within the civilengineering community and beyond—and around the globe. The engineering community, especially the civil engineering community, is global and, as such, should share a common vision and work together to achieve it. Now that the Summit is complete, the vision articulated, and the report completed, leaders of civil engineering organizations around the globe should move the civil engineering community toward the vision. Meeting this challenge will require active engagement on a variety of environmental and infrastructure fronts. 2006:\n\nStatus, Concerns, and Opportunities in the Civil Engineering Profession\n\nUnless we hasten, we shall be left behind. —Lucius Annaeus Seneca, Roman philosopher\n\nCivil engineers are rightfully proud of their legacy. During the past century, clean water supplies have extended general life expectancies. Transportation systems serve as an economic and social engine. New bridges, blending strength and beauty, speed transport and bring communities closer together. Public and private construction, for which engineers provide the essential underpinnings of design and project oversight, produces hundreds of thousands of jobs and drives community development. From the functional and beautiful Golden Gate Bridge in the United States, Petronas Towers in Malaysia, and Pont du Gard in France to the largely hidden water supply and sanitary sewer systems, civil engineers have made their mark in many aspects of the daily life of essentially everyone around the globe. Issues and Trends\n\nCivil engineers know they cannot rest on their laurels. Current trends pose questions about the future of the profession. These questions address the role that civil engineers play—and could play—in society, in the ultimate integrity of the world’s infrastructure, and in the health of the natural environment. For many years, civil engineering leaders sounded the alarm about the lack of investment in maintaining and improving the infrastructure. Some of those shortcomings were tragically illustrated by the death and destruction caused by failures in which engineering designs, government funding, and the community oversight systems were all called into question. Civil engineers are painfully aware of the consequences for public health, safety, and welfare when the infrastructure does not get the attention it requires. Proud of its\n\nlegacy, the global civil engineering community cannot rest on its laurels. Public health, safety, and welfare require giving even more attention to infrastructure and the environment. Civil engineers must be more active in the policy- and decision- making process. Pressures felt by the civil engineering profession include the role of\n\nsoftware in design, commoditization of services, and impact of globalization. Yet those same engineers also know that they could do better in speaking out in the social and political arena, and in becoming leaders in the policy- and decision-making process, to ensure it is based on a sound technical foundation. Civil engineers know they must step up to the plate and participate in political and public service. The public has become increasingly aware that development need not result in a compromised and depleted environment. Enlightened citizens see sustainability, not as an unattainable ideal, but as a practical goal. To answer that call, civil engineers realize that they must increasingly transform themselves from designers and builders to project life-cycle “sustainers.”\n\nSuch broadened responsibilities—along with the increasing breadth, complexity, and rate of change of professional practice— all put greater emphasis not only on continuing education but also on what a basic civil engineering education must deliver up front. The body of knowledge necessary to effectively practice civil engineering at the professional level is beyond the scope of the traditional bachelor’s degree, even when coupled with the mandated early-career experience. Education must meld technical excellence with the ability to lead, influence, and integrate—preparing the engineer to weigh the diverse societal issues that shape the optimal approaches to planning, design, and construction. New Pressures\n\nTechnology and market forces place additional pressures on how civil engineers play out their roles. Knowledge-based civil engineering software increasingly shifts routine engineering tasks from the realm of the engineer to that of the technologist and technician. How will this trend play out in the years ahead? Will civil engineers move further into a systems role? Civil engineering risks becoming commoditized. Clients and owners may increasingly use low-bid procurement—and thus the lowest innovation denominator—rather than qualifications- based selection and its opportunities to provide the best life-cycle options. Further, how will civil engineers in advanced nations react as the need to have project teams all in one place continues to shrink and lower-cost engineers from rapidly expanding technological workforces around the world vie for a piece of the\n\nglobal economic pie? Will economic forces expand the pie with more work for all engineers or will barriers be erected to slow the negative affect on local employment? How will civil engineers gain the needed knowledge of international business practices and cultural and linguistic issues, and will they further address corruption in the global engineering and construction industry? These factors challenge the status quo. As a result, some, now dominant countries may have a diminishing global role in engineering research and education and in the application of new technology. Because of their work with infrastructure and the environment, civil engineers can contribute to world stability. Consider one example: Virtually every nation is either facing some type of water supply challenge today or will face one within 20 years. That demand for this life-giving resource, coupled with the need to share it across national boundaries, could create an explosive situation. The application of civil engineering knowledge and skills to enhance water supply and improve distribution could become one of civil engineering’s greatest challenges. Career Appeal\n\nAll these issues represent critical tests for civil engineers, with new responsibilities looming ahead for a new generation. For many years, the profession has wrestled with its career appeal to a diverse population of the best and brightest. How can pre-college students learn more about the civil engineering opportunities for both helping mankind and building a fulfilling life for themselves at acompetitive compensation? And when job assignments do not match the promise of stimulating work, how can management help while still building the bottom line? Future Directions\n\nCivil engineers thus find themselves as keepers of an impressive legacy while raising concerns about future directions. They know they must take more risks."

        "They know they must show more leadership. They know they must control their own destiny rather than letting events control them. The Summit on the Future of Civil Engineering in 2025 represented an ambitious step on the road to that new future. Participants asked: What will the civil engineering world be like 20 years from now? What aspirational role will civil engineers play in that radically transformed world? The visionary gauntlet has been thrown down. Clearly, looking ahead toward the unknown presents considerable risk. Future realities may not be captured and some aspects of the vision may prove to be a mirage. But the visionary gauntlet has been thrown down. A diverse group of accomplished individuals gathered at the Summit to look beyond today’s strategic issues to place their signposts for what the civil engineering profession should attain by 2025. The march toward those markers—and the enlightened struggles needed to get there—are only just beginning. The global civil engineering profession has taken up the challenge. Why a Summit? Never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world. It is the only thing that ever has. —Margaret Mead, anthropologist\n\nThe Summit on the Future of Civil Engineering was convened in response to the status of, concerns with, and opportunities for the civil engineering profession. A highly-varied group of civil engineers, engineers from other disciplines, architects, educators, association and society executives, and other leaders, including participants from eight countries outside the United States,’ attended. All gathered in Landsdowne, Virginia from June 21 to 23, 2006. The Summit’s purpose was to articulate an aspirational global vision for the future of civil engineering—addressing all levels and facets of the civil engineering community, that is, professional (licensed) civil engineers, non-licensed civil engineers, technologists, and technicians. The Summit’s goal reflects the organizers’ and participants’ preference of choice over chance. Statesman William Jennings Bryan highlighted those options when he said, “Destiny is not a matter of chance; it is a matter of choice.”! Broadly speaking, there are only two futures for civil engineering around the globe; the one the profession creates for itself or, in a void, the one others create for civil engineering. Civil engineers came to the Summit to choose their profession’s future. The purpose of this report is to outline the highly interactive process used during the Summit and more importantly to present, in detail, the Summit’s results. This report is a call to action for individuals and organizations that can help to achieve the vision’s goals. The Summit on the Future of Civil Engineering in 2025 proved to bea stimulating, uplifting, collaborative, and creative experience for participants. Breakout groups generated wide-ranging discussions, and post-Summit synthesis of their ideas yielded the final vision. Leaders gathered at the Summit to articulate a global vision for civil engineering. This report presents thoughts of leaders who participated in the highly-interactive Summit. The civil engineering community is global and should share a common vision. As valuable as that may be, the Summit is just the beginning of a forward-looking process. Summit organizers—and probably the vast majority of participants—want the global vision, as presented in this report, to guide policies, plans, processes, and progress within the global civil engineering community. This vision can influence civil engineering around the world and engage other engineering disciplines and professions as well. While the civil engineering community is global with many diverse interests, it could and perhaps should rally around a common vision to the benefit of all. The Vision for Civil Engineering\n\nFar better it is to dare mighty things,\n\nto win glorious triumphs,\n\neven though checkered by failure,\n\nthan to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in the gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat. —Theodore Roosevelt, 26\" U.S. President\n\nVision\n\nThe Summit produced a series of aspirational visions stimulated by participant views of the world of 2025. The resulting integrated global aspirational vision is:\n\nEntrusted by society to create a sustainable world and enhance the global quality of life, civil engineers serve competently, collaboratively, and ethically as master:\n\ne planners, designers, constructors, and operators In 2025, civil of society's economic and social engine—the built engineers will serve environment; as master builders, environmental e stewards of the natural environment and its resources; stewards, innovators and integrators,\n\ne innovators and integrators of ideas and technology\n\n: d - managers of risk across the public, private, and academic sectors; 9\n\nand uncertainty, and e managers of risk and uncertainty caused by natural leaders in shaping events, accidents, and other threats; and public policy. e leaders in discussions and decisions shaping public environmental and infrastructure policy. Personal attributes— knowledge, skills, and attitudes—must expand to meet the challenges of 2025. As used in the vision, “master” means to possess widely recognized and valued knowledge and skills and other attributes acquired as a result of education, experience, and achievement. Individuals, within a profession, who have these characteristics are often willing and able to serve society by orchestrating solutions to society’s most pressing current needs while helping to create a more viable future. Profile of the 2025 Civil Engineer\n\nWhat could civil engineers be doing in 2025? In addressing this question Summit participants created a profile of the civil engineer in 2025, that is, the attributes possessed by the individual consistent with the profession’s aspirational vision. Attributes may be defined as desirable knowledge, skills, and attitudes. As used here, knowledge is largely cognitive and consists of theories, principles, and fundamentals. Examples are geometry, calculus, vectors, momentum, friction, stress and strain, fluid mechanics, energy, continuity, and variability. In contrast, skill refers to the ability to do tasks. Examples are using a spreadsheet; continuous learning; problem solving; critical, global, integrative/system, and creative thinking; teamwork; communication; and self-assessment. Formal education is the primary source of knowledge, whereas skills are developed via formal education, focused training, and on-the-job experience. Attitudes reflect an individual’s values and determine how he or she perceives, interprets, and approaches the world. Attitudes conducive to effective professional practice include commitment, curiosity, honesty, integrity, objectivity, optimism, sensitivity, thoroughness, and tolerance. Summit participants identified many, varied attributes, organized into the categories of knowledge, skills, and attitudes. The results are presented here. The civil engineer is knowledgeable. He or she understands the theories, principles, and/or fundamentals of:\n\ne Mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, mechanics, and materials, which are the foundation of engineering\n\ne Design of structures, facilities, and systems\n\ne Risk/uncertainty, such as risk identification, data-based and knowledge-based types, and probability and statistics\n\ne Sustainability, including social, economic, and physical dimensions\n\ne Public policy and administration, including elements such as the political process, laws and regulations, and funding mechanisms\n\ne Business basics, such as legal forms of ownership, profit, income statements and balance sheets, decision or engineering economics, and marketing\n\ne Social sciences, including economics, history, and sociology\n\ne Ethical behavior, including client confidentiality, codes of ethics within and outside of engineering societies, anti- corruption and the differences between legal requirements and ethical expectations, and the profession’s responsibility to hold paramount public health, safety, and welfare\n\nThe civil engineer is skillful. He or she knows how to:\n\ne Apply basic engineering tools, such as statistical analysis, computer models, design codes and standards, and project monitoring methods\n\ne Learn about, assess, and master new technology to enhance individual and organizational effectiveness and efficiency\n\ne Communicate with technical and non-technical audiences, convincingly and with passion, through listening, speaking, writing, mathematics, and visuals\n\ne Collaborate on intra-disciplinary, cross-disciplinary, and multi-disciplinary traditional and virtual teams*\n\ne Manage tasks, projects, and programs to provide expected deliverables while satisfying budget, schedule, and other constraints\n\ne Lead by formulating and articulating environmental, infrastructure, and other improvements and build consensus by practicing inclusiveness, empathy, compassion, persuasiveness, patience, and critical thinking\n\nThe civil engineer\n\nis knowledgeable about technical and professional, as well as socio-economic, topics. The civil engineer possesses many and varied skills. The civil engineer embraces a range\n\nof attitudes that supplement knowledge and\n\nskills and facilitate effective professional practice within industry, education, and government. The civil engineer embraces attitudes conducive to effective professional practice. He or she exhibits:\n\ne Creativity and entrepreneurship that leads to proactive identification of possibilities and opportunities and taking action to develop them\n\ne Commitment to ethics, personal and organizational goals, and worthy teams and organizations\n\ne Curiosity, which is a basis for continued learning, fresh approaches, development of new technology or innovative applications of existing technology, and new endeavors\n\ne Honesty and integrity—telling the truth and keeping one’s word. e Optimism in the face of challenges and setbacks, recognizing the power inherent in vision, commitment, planning, persistence, flexibility, and teamwork\n\ne Respect for and tolerance of the rights, values, views, property, possessions, and sensitivities of others\n\ne Thoroughness and self-discipline in keeping with the public health, safety, and welfare implications for most engineering projects and the high-degree of interdependence within project teams and between teams and their stakeholders\n\nMany ofthe preceding attributes are shared with other professions. Civil engineering’s uniqueness is revealed in how the attributes enable the profession to do what it does and, more importantly, to become what it wants to be. This is inherent in the global aspirational vision. 2025: The Civil Engineer’s World\n\nIn a time of drastic change,\n\nit is the learners who inherit the future. The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists. —Eric Hoffer, self-taught philosopher\n\nThe Summit generated many, varied ideas by discussing the civil engineer’s world of 2025. More specifically, the breakout groups addressed two questions:\n\ne What will be different in the world of 2025? e What could civil engineers be doing in that different world? The answer to the first defines the stage on which civil engineers will perform two decades from now. Answers to the second define the roles civil engineers could play. While civil engineers will not be able to greatly influence the stage, they can determine the acts they will appear in and the roles they will play. The following scenario was developed using Summit results and a pre-Summit ASCE member survey about aspirations and visions for civil engineering in 2025. The Scenario Begins\n\nThe year is 2025. At the second World Civil Engineering Societies Triennial Symposium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, engineers from industry, education, and government met to continue the collaboration started six years ago in Porto, Portugal. At the conclusion of deliberations, conference organizers submitted the following reports about the status of the sustainability of the world, research and development, risk management, innovation and integration, and reform in the preparation of engineers. Civil engineers can determine the roles they will play in the world of 2025. Consistent with the vision, a 2025 scenario was developed. Civil engineers have helped raise global expectations for sustainability and for environmental stewardship. The shift of people from rural to urban areas increasingly strained the overburdened infrastructure. A Sustainable World\n\nThe global civil engineering profession has increasingly recognized the reality of shrinking resources, the desire for sustainable practices and design, and the need for social equity in the consumption of resources. Civil engineers have helped raise global expectations for sustainability and for environmental stewardship. The profession has led world acceptance of green design and has been at the forefront in making environmental considerations part of life-cycle and cost-benefit analyses. Civil engineers have urged clients to use new, environmentally-friendly technologies to improve the quality of life in urban environments. Designs routinely incorporate recycling, either by using recycled materials, or by making project components recyclable at the end of their useful life. New processes, less harmful to the environment, have been implemented, and most new construction is based on green and smart-building technologies. Many new buildings actually produce more energy than they consume. On the demographic front, the world is well on its way to a population exceeding 10 billion people in 2050. Today, people occupy more space on the planet than they did 30 years ago, and they are straining the earth’s environment, particularly the needs for energy, fresh water, clean air, and safe waste disposal. During the past 30 years, gradual global warming has profoundly affected the more than half of the world’s population that lives within 50 miles of coastal areas. These areas have become much harsher places to live because of sea-level rise, increased storm activity, and greater susceptibility to flooding. Growing population, shrinking resources, and climate change have put sustainability at the forefront of issues requiring global attention. Shifting demographics and population growth continue to strain the overburdened infrastructure. The shift of people from rural areas to cities and exurban areas has accelerated, resulting in increased population density around the world. In the developed world, infrastructure is aging, and maintenance or replacement has not kept pace with its deterioration. In the developing world, the need for new infrastructure outstrips society’s ability to put it in place. Influenced by civil engineering leadership, people now better understand the crucial link between infrastructure and quality of life, which has caused a major public policy shift in favor of improved infrastructure maintenance and accelerated infrastructure construction. Twenty-five years after promulgation of the Millennium Development Goals, some progress has been made, but the goals remain for the most part un-met against a backdrop of increasingly urgent global demand for environmental security and restoration. Improved understanding of the environment and the acceptance of broadly shared environmental values have led to an increased understanding that global environmental problems must be solved with global solutions. Nations unwilling to accept these values face worldwide pressure to conform to global norms for sustainability to improve the quality of life around the world. Demands for sustainable energy, fresh water, clean air, and safe waste disposal drive infrastructure development on a global scale. Constrained resources and growing energy demands have led to the need to prioritize energy resources and use alternative fuels. The use of clean coal along with carbon sequestration, nuclear energy, and renewable sources such as wind, solar, waves, and geothermal have made it possible to meet growing demands. In addition, increased urbanization has led to greatly increased use of mass transit and much less reliance on personal automobiles, which has greatly reduced demand for fossil fuels. Most vehicles now use fuel cell technology or renewable resources, such as ethanol. The need for fresh water continues to be a global issue. Rapid urbanization in developing countries has made it a challenge to meet ever-growing demands for clean water. Improved water purification methods, desalination technologies, and increasing use of closed-loop systems have helped meet needs. There is a growing use of gray-water systems and a changing philosophy to purify water at the point-of-use in decentralized systems. This has reduced the need to treat large quantities of water to drinking water standards when only a small fraction is taken internally by humans. It has also led to energy savings for water treatment. The principles of sustainability are also driving demands for safe waste disposal and for increased recycling and re-use to make substantial reductions in the waste stream. Advances in nuclear technology have changed the requirements for disposal of highly radioactive nuclear waste. Life-cycle design philosophies have taken hold resulting in nearly zero net waste and great savings in energy consumed for waste disposal. Virtually everything is recycled and re-used. New global standards for sustainable design, promulgated by non-government organizations (NGOs), have been implemented to meet the global demand for sustainability, overtaking the\n\nDemands for sustainable energy, fresh water, clean air, and safe waste disposal drive global infrastructure development. Life cycle design philosophies have been widely adopted. As a result of leadership and collaboration, the gaps between advanced, developing, and underdeveloped nations have been reduced. Civil engineers provide critical guidance for determining public policy and defining the research agenda. Civil engineering has helped define the nanoscience, nanotechnology, and biotechnology research agenda. ability of any one country to maintain its own unique standards. Adoption of these international standards and best practices for sustainability has been facilitated by a growing awareness of liability concerns on a global scale. Increasingly, drivers for individual projects address regional and global issues as well as local issues because of converging environmental outlooks in the global community and the need for the sustainability and project integrity. One key to stability in the world is greater equality among living standards. Ahead of plan, leadership and collaboration with major stakeholders around the world have closed the gap between advanced, developing, and underdeveloped nations. Innovative approaches have resulted in infrastructure addition, removal, repair, or replacement based on the changed societal requirements. Engineers are recognized as leaders, teachers, and learners in a wide range of environmental and infrastructure topics. Infrastructure financing routinely involves life-cycle costing analysis with public debate as to tradeoffs for different issues. Research and Development\n\nFacing daunting issues following multiple global natural and manmade disasters in the first decade of the 21st century, along with an apparent lack of data pertaining to design, maintenance, and lessons learned, an international commission was established to define a strategic direction for global investment in research and development. As a result, civil engineers have led the shift from a remedial to preventive approach. The profession has defined a balanced approach in driving the research agenda, spearheading intra-disciplinary, cross- disciplinary, and multi-disciplinary collaboration in prioritizing basic research needs on national and global levels. In addition, civil engineers provide critical technical guidance in defining public policy throughout the government and global commissions. At the turn of the century, a major challenge in assessing the risk of technological innovation lay in validating results where the body of knowledge was minimal at best. A protocol established over the last decade, which embraces the practice of conducting clinical trials, has led to breakthrough advances in research for application in the manmade and natural environments. In addition, the methodology calls for greater transparency and sharing of information with the public sector. Civil engineering quickly moved to the forefront to define the research agenda for nanoscience, nanotechnology, and biotechnology applications in the 2025 infrastructure environment. Engineers recognized that nanoscience and nanotech products are the vehicles for major technological innovation across a spectrum of products affecting virtually every industry sector. Civil engineers from across industry, academia, and government worked on the development of instrumentation, metrology, and standards to realize a robust nanomanufacturing capability. This permitted the physical dimensions, properties, and functionality of the materials, processes, tools, systems, and products that constituted nanomanufacturing to be measured and characterized. This, in turn, enabled production to be controlled, predicted, and scaled to meet market needs. In 2025, the civil engineering enterprise is focused on fast-track development and deployment of technologies. Steps taken by the profession during the past two decades in the areas of information technology and data management have significantly improved how facilities are designed, engineered, built, and maintained. Civil engineers and the profession are now focused on using application to drive technology. In addition, research now shows that technological improvements today may enable applications not yet identified. Civil engineers have reversed the image of being risk averse to new technology, instead relying on and leveraging real-time access to living databases, sensors, diagnostic tools, and other advanced technologies to ensure informed decisions are made. Highly-integrated planning and construction tools, supported by four-dimensional databases, have been enabled by significant research investment in expanded computing capability. Data flows freely and is available at all times, representing current conditions. Latent defects are addressed early in the design, and flowed back into the parent database. Intelligent infrastructure (such as, embedded sensors and real- time onboard diagnostics) have led to this transformation of rapidly advancing and adapting high-value technologies in the material fixed “pre-preg”? and design phases. Real-time monitoring, sensing, data acquisition, storage, and modeling have greatly enhanced prediction time leading to informed decisions. Robotics, emulating the human factors, provide another greater dimension for non-human intervention in high-risk areas of infrastructure. The profession’s advancements\n\nin information technology and data management have improved the design, construction, and maintenance of facilities. The effort to manage and mitigate risk is led by civil engineers. Civil engineers have been in the forefront in developing and applying global, performance-based codes and standards. Intelligent sensors have put productivity at an all-time high. Smart chip technologies enhance materials tracking, speed construction, and reduce costs. Wearable computing devices facilitate communication among onsite engineers, workers, and inspectors and provide access to remote documents and resources across global divides. Managing Risk\n\nThe world of 2025 presents a high-risk environment, with the ongoing threat of large-scale natural disasters and possible acts of terrorism. Civil engineers are at the forefront in developing appropriate approaches and designs to managing and mitigating risk, realizing that high reward can come from high-risk solutions. Project-specific risk decisions are made at multiple levels as engineers become leaders of enterprise risk management, with some carrying the title of chief risk officer. Risk is clearly a major driver of innovation, as engineers evaluate what new materials, processes, and designs might be used while weighing the potential for failure—balancing risk versus reward. Engineers reduce risk and, therefore, liability exposure by building living models of major structures that incorporate untried technologies and by investigating, in a flexible way, long-term performance. To aid the process, governments have instituted faster turnaround times for new regulations, permitting ever accelerating innovation. The application of global, performance-based codes and standards has become widespread in enhancing the world’s infrastructure, and civil engineers have been at the forefront in developing such guidelines. To address heightened threats and threat variability from place to place, the global codes and standards have become risk-based, thereby more readily addressing local conditions. Natural and terrorist threats continue to change as world conditions evolve, and developers of codes and standards have become more proficient and proactive in adapting standards accordingly. In addressing the variations of local risk, engineers are also educating society on the limitations of new technology so that educated decisions can be made on how infrastructure is constructed while also managing expectations. This realistic management of expectations, however, has not degraded the standard of care. Large, multi-national corporations have continued to expand and become major economic forces on a global scale, with total corporate revenues exceeding the gross domestic product (GDP)\n\nof many nations. Due in part to the interrelated nature of their global production and supply network, they have gained great influence over environmental norms and standards across nations. These multi-national corporations are now major drivers of global environmental standards, and the opportunity for promoting tougher standards in all countries has grown. Economic forces help drive such environmental improvement, but less stringent environmental standards still prevail in some lesser-developed countries. Local compliance issues also remain a challenge. Master Innovators and Integrators\n\nIn the civil engineering profession, project delivery has become an increasingly complex and diverse process. Twenty-five years ago, an owner often hired a design professional to develop plans and specifications that were given to a contractor who transformed them into a finished product. The design team of 2025 includes a multitude of participants, many of whom are not in the engineering profession, but in related areas of management, environmental sciences, social sciences, legal, planning, geographic and other disciplines. Likewise, the contractor’s team no longer comprises a few trades, but dozens of trades that are specialized in particular areas coming together in a managed process to complete the constructed project. As the master innovators and integrators, civil engineers are the leaders who help develop and implement new technologies to create appropriate competitive advantages. Civil engineers are educated, trained, and well-equipped to be at the forefront of adapting and integrating these new technologies into both design and construction. Civil engineers recognize that a narrow focus on construction is no longer valid. Their focus must be multi-faceted, multi-disciplined, and holistic. Civilengineersarealsotheleadersindevelopingandimplementing appropriate continuing education that encompasses the master builder/integrator concept. The team and integrator attributes are part of the continuing education curriculum. As master innovators and integrators, the real-time exchange of ideas between engineers and other professionals has facilitated great teamwork in decentralized work environments.

Some have reported that the focus on the project outcome, not which discipline was in charge, has led to dramatic changes."

        "The civil engineer, as a master integrator, facilitated this improvement. Reform in the Preparation of Engineers\n\nLed by civil engineers, the global engineering profession has implemented broad changes to the academic prerequisites to professional practice. Today, those seeking admission to the professional practice of engineering must demonstrate that they have fulfilled the appropriate body of knowledge through education and experience. Gaining acceptance of the body of knowledge concept has taken more than 20 years, but is now common practice throughout much of the world. Civil engineering education and early experience have been reformed. This change was driven in part by the recognition that academia and industry need to cooperate and partner in the delivery of baccalaureate, post-baccalaureate, and lifelong learning educational activities. Industry has aggressively brought real-world issues into university classrooms and has implemented broad steps to ensure continuing professional development of engineers throughout their careers. The academic-industrial partnership has enabled formal education to keep pace with new technologies and rapidly-changing current practices. The sea change in engineering education—both formal and on-the-job—has transformed civil engineering into a “learning profession,” further enhancing its image as a problem-defining and problem-solving profession in the eyes of the public. This enhanced reputation as a learning profession that identifies opportunities and addresses major problems has been cited as a key reason why great numbers of young people are making civil engineering their career of choice. Civil engineering’s outreach to help build capacity in the developing world has “put a human face” on the profession, which in turn has attracted more women, minorities, and people interested in social justice to the ranks of civil engineers. Because of this influx of new faces, the civil engineering profession today mirrors the population it serves. In addition to requiring body of knowledge fulfillment for entry into professional practice, the civil engineering profession has led the way in recognizing specialty certification as a means of demonstrating competency in specialized areas of civil engineering. During the past 20 years, specialty certification has become widely recognized, both within and outside the profession, as a measure of proficiency in a technical field. As a result of both board certification and reform in the preparation of civil engineers, the public perception of civil engineers as knowledgeable professionals has steadily improved. Civil engineers have also been at the forefront of curbing corruption in the construction industry worldwide. Engineering ethics is one of the cornerstones, and academia and industry have fostered lifelong learning in this key area. Now back to 2007..."

        "What Next? When we build, let it not be for present use alone. Let it be such work as our descendants will thank us for. —John Ruskin, philosopher\n\nThe aspirational vision presented in this report represents a beginning—the springboard to launch a sustainable, influential process so that the vision for civil engineering in 2025 can be attained. The Summit’s sole goal was to define this aspirational vision; it was not to create the roadmap on how to achieve it. That map-making begins now—with you. If we are to succeed, we must rally everyone in the engineering community to help move this process forward. Now that the vision has been set and the future envisioned, leaders have a target to guide their policies, plans, processes, and progress on a broad and diverse front, within and outside the engineering community. After all, simply publishing the vision for the future will accomplish little. In moving forward, leaders in the civil engineering community should recognize that:\n\ne Avvariety of partners must be engaged, and opportunities for collaboration and action identified. e The international engineering community must also be engaged to maximize the reaches of the vision to the global civil engineering community. e The public and policy-makers must be engaged so that the profession serves society to the fullest. e The education and training of future civil engineers and the continued development of today’s civil engineers must include and go beyond the required technical competencies. Forging a long-term action plan to achieve the vision will require input and cooperation from a diverse group of leaders and organizations. Individual leaders within the civil engineering community must build awareness and excitement for achieving\n\nThe vision presented in this report\n\nis intended to inspire the global civil engineering community. Civil engineers must commit to meeting milestones in achieving the vision. the vision. Additionally, civil engineering organizations have to create momentum toward the attainment of the vision within their organizations. Specific opportunities to present the vision for 2025 at board meetings, annual conferences, and the like must be identified and pursued. Organizations need to share knowledge and work together to make measurable progress toward the vision. For example, within the United States, ASCE, the American Association of Engineering Societies, the American Council of Engineering Companies, and others might collaborate, holding joint workshops or conferences that focus on how to accomplish the vision for the civil engineering profession. Partnering with sister organizations such as the American Institute of Architects, the American Planning Association, and others will also maximize the success in meeting the goals for civil engineering. In addition to technical and professional organizations, client- related organizations must also be engaged. Finally, civil engineers must also engage the public—the primary beneficiaries of civil engineering services. Such efforts among individuals and organizations around the world will be key to the achievement of the vision. Today’s civil engineers will need to transform themselves to meet the challenges of tomorrow. They must stay abreast of changing technologies, market trends, and business developments. Civil engineers need to develop and implement new methods and products that are sustainable and sensitive to the environment. Moreover, they must cultivate the new technologies, direct the market, and develop new business practices to lead the transformation into tomorrow. Educating future civil engineers is also an essential component of the vision for the civil engineering profession in 2025. Fulfilling the vision requires an expanded set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes, highlighting the need for curricula reform today to develop that knowledge and those skills and attitudes needed in 2025. Colleges and universities must examine their curricula as they relate to the future civil engineer so advancement toward the vision can be realized. In the United States, ABET, Inc. would bea targeted partner in this area. Similarly, experienced engineers should coach and mentor younger engineers with the goal of enhancing knowledge, skills, and attitudes initially acquired during formal education. Several aspects of the vision relate to the civilengineer’s interaction with the public. Civil engineers aim to be—and be perceived as—trusted advisors to the public and policy-makers regarding\n\ninfrastructure. To accomplish this, civil engineers must show the public how their services touch the public daily and improve lives. In particular, the civil engineering community must increasingly seek opportunities to use its abilities to improve the quality of life in more areas of the world with our services. Now is the time to develop workable and economically feasible solutions to the world’s infrastructure needs. The public must be engaged in this continuing process to raise the quality of infrastructure. U.S. civil engineers can be catalysts in sharing the vision with the global civil engineering community. The surest path to success is the integration of knowledge from civil engineers within a broad range of economies, cultures, and circumstances. Conferences conducted by international engineering groups, such as the World Federation of Engineering Organizations, are excellent vehicles for obtaining concurrence and determining a direction for the international civil engineering profession of 2025. Collective, long-term actions to help achieve the vision might include:\n\ne A more robust educational path for civil engineers that prepares them for leadership and provides the multifaceted non-technical skills to serve on projects affecting the public good. e A more clearly defined organizational structure for the engineering team, where the licensed civil engineer takes on the role of master program/project integrator. e More civil engineers involved in public policy forums where future directions for society are developed and where civil engineers can gain the public’s trust. e More civil engineers elected to public office where they can directly influence infrastructure and sustainability policy and legislation. e A greater level of collaboration and communication among civil engineers and those non-engineer stakeholders, seeking to balance a sustainable environment with needed infrastructure. e Increased research and development to mitigate the effects of natural disasters, with civil engineers playing a leading role in devising and implementing the innovations. e Greater education and training of engineers in ethics and a greater emphasis on ethics in global engineering practice, allowing engineers to serve as role models. e Sharing the vision with pre-college students, and their parents and counselors, to better inform them about the profession and thus attract even more of the best and brightest to it. We hope that through these first sketches of possible action, you, the reader, will begin to contemplate how you, your organizations, and your countries can begin planning and implementing the next steps to making this vision a reality. This will be no small task. However, a united civil engineering community can start the hard work that will ultimately fulfill that promise.

APPENDIX A Keynote Presentations\n\nLooking Ahead: How Do We Think About 2025? Michael Rogers Futurist\n\nGood evening, ladies and gentlemen. I deeply regret that circumstances have made it impossible for me to travel and join you in person at dinner tonight. But hopefully through the miracle of modern technology I’ll still be able to provide a somewhat ethereal voice of the future. The situation reminds me a bit of a speech I gave late last year in Japan, where there was a translator and wireless headphones for most of the audience. The speaker ahead of me was also American and midway through his speech, he told a joke—which I always consider rather risky in Japanese translation—but after amoment he got a nice round of laughter. I gave my speech and afterwards went up to the translator and congratulated him on his skill at translating so well that even the joke got a laugh. “I must tell you the truth,” the translator told me. “What I said was: ‘Now the speaker has told a joke.”\n\nSo please don’t be surprised if every once in a while during this speech I say, “Now the speaker is waving his arms.”\n\nEver since I began discussing this occasion with David and Meggan, months ago, I’ve looked forward to being in such distinguished company and helping in some small way to launch what I think is a terrific and admirable mission. On a personal level, as well, I saw this as an opportunity to do something that would have made my late father proud. He was an engineer of the generation that went through school on the GI bill in aeronautical engineering and then found himself drawn to the space program and then ultimately to weapons work, at which he did well and advanced quite far professionally. In his late forties he began to have increasing moral qualms about the work—one day he found himself using the word megadeaths in casual conversation. He left weapons and retrained in civil engineering and spent the rest of his career working for the county of San Bernardino\n\nin Southern California—starting over pretty much at the bottom, but nonetheless he’d tell anyone that he found that work vastly more satisfying and meaningful than anything he’d done at Cape Canaveral or for the DOD, because he what he did palpably changed lives for the better, at the time and more importantly for him, far into the future. And the future is what I want to talk about tonight—or at least the part of it that will fit into 40 minutes or so. So I’ll leave much untouched, but I know from the schedule that over the next two days you’ll cover all the rest and much more. First, a bit of personal perspective on thinking about the future. I spent 20 years at The Washington Post Company helping a very conservative organization move into the future and in the course of it made enough false steps to greatly enhance my appreciation of just how hard it is predict what’s going to happen next. Two things that I did learn: the first, that very often the future doesn’t happen as quickly as the experts say it will. Technologists are terribly good at looking ahead and seeing how all the pieces of the technology puzzle are going to fit together and produce some spectacular, society- changing circumstance. But what they’re not good at seeing is all the little bumps and obstacles on the road to the future—social restraints, financial limitations, and the general tendency of the status quo to maintain itself. The visions of futurists too often remind me of a spot in central California, where you can stand and see Mt. Whitney, the tallest mountain in the lower 48 states, as clear and sharp as if it’s just a few miles distant, and it appears that you could stroll out to the foothills ina pleasant afternoon. But should you actually set out on that stroll, you’d find that between you and Mt. Whitney is the very long expanse of Death Valley. I think it’s safe to say that far too many organizations have started out with that clear vision in mind and not long thereafter found themselves mired in some Death Valley of technology. But that’s not to say that the vision itself isn’t something important to maintain—and indeed I think the choice of the word “vision” for your efforts here over the next two days is an excellent one indeed. And that leads to my second thought about predicting the future. Ina sense, I think what your profession does—like many others today—is practice the art of being practical futurists. That’s actually the name of a column | started at Newsweek, and initially I have to say that I chose the phrase because it seemed a bit of a humorous oxymoron; I certainly didn’t consider myself to be anything like a professional futurist. But the more I thought about it the more I realized that there was something to the phrase. Like a professional futurist, the practical futurist has to make some assumptions about what the future will be like. But then unlike the professional futurist (whose predictions are probably long forgotten by the time the future actually happens, and thus incurs no penalty for error), the practical futurist has to place some bets—with their projects, budgets, staffing, technology choices, education, and so on. And if the practical futurist is wrong, he or she pays a price. Practical futurism is a bit like sailing upwind. First you need to determine an end point—your best guess as to where you want to end up in the future."

    [
        "But you rarely have the chance to sail directly to your destination. Maybe the technology you need isn’t ready for prime time yet; perhaps your current budget won’t cover everything you’d like to do; maybe you haven’t yet convinced top management that your vision is correct; perhaps you haven’t fully amortized your existing infrastructure—or any of dozens of other potential impediments to direct progress. So the practical futurist moves forward by tacking to one side, then the other, all the while keeping the end destination in mind. The one absolute: make sure you’re never heading directly opposite from where you ultimately want to land. In the end, the future happens incrementally, not all at once. Now, with all those caveats about the future in place, let me try to suggest some structures and models within which to conjure up a sense of 2025. I’d like to do that from two specific perspectives: the first, the impact of the automobile on infrastructure and society in the previous century, and then the impact of the next generation—the first generation raised never knowing a world without the Internet—on this century. First, the automobile. I think that if you were a practical person at the turn of the previous century, circa 1905, you would have looked at the early automobile and said, “Yes, I can see how this will be a somewhat useful invention, at some point in time. Of course it’s still too hard to use, and gasoline is difficult to come by, and there are relatively few roads good enough to even support the device, but sooner or later, I can see that this will catch on with some people. I might even be able to use it in my business at some point.”\n\nVery few people, I’ll contend, at that point in time would have said: “This invention will rapidly reshape the landscape of America. It will change where we live, where we work, how we shop, even how we meet our mates.” Yet that’s exactly what the automobile did in the first half of the last century. And I’m going to argue that that’s what the intersection of cheap computing and ubiquitous Internet access will do to our country during the first half of this century—perhaps not on\n\nsuch a grand physical scale, but most certainly capable of exerting as fundamental a retooling of our economic infrastructure. How will the information revolution accomplish this? To begin with the obvious: over the next 20 years, computing power will become both enormous and tiny. Moore’s law of doubling yields and falling prices now looks good through 2020; and Texas Instruments just announced yesterday yet another way to reduce transistor size on wafers. The result will be very powerful computers ona chip, integrating both processors and memory components, that can be built into almost any object on earth. Perhaps even more important than the increase in computing power and memory, however, will be the rise of intelligent sensors: devices that add the ability to sense any kind of physical phenomena from the obvious—temperature or strain—to more subtle aspects like chemical and atmospheric changes or even the number of people in a room. The cost of these intelligent sensors will plunge also, and increasingly they will be part of the fabric of construction everywhere. Another aspect of the telecom revolution will radically increase the utility of these smart sensors, and that is the availability of huge amounts of Internet bandwidth, virtually anywhere in the world. The comparison I often make is that bandwidth is currently like computer memory was in the ’80s—you never have quite enough of it, and it was expensive to buy more. Nowadays, of course, we buy a computer with a gigabyte of main memory and don’t think twice about it. In a similar fashion, over the next decade, the cost will plummet and high-speed, always-on Internet connectivity will be available virtually anywhere. Several factors will drive that. First, the lighting of all the “dark” fiber that was laid underground during the telecom bubble of the late ’90s—there’s still a bunch of it, and by now it can be used with orders of magnitude more efficiency. Secondly, we’re starting to see a rapid rise in wireless Internet connectivity with the emerging WiMAX standard. That will only accelerate in 2009, as all of the analog television transmitters are turned off and their valuable “beachfront spectrum” is auctioned off and almost certainly redeployed for yet more wireless broadband. And finally, improvements in low Earth orbit satellite Internet service will gradually fill in whatever spaces remain unprovisioned. Connecting it all together will be the Internet—which sounds like a terribly obvious observation, but here’s why it’s significant. For the first time in the history of data transmission, the Internet is driving truly global standards. Throughout the latter decades of the last century, attempts to create broad data networks that cut across multiple locales\n\nand industries usually foundered on various kinds of incompatibility, either of hardware, software or data structure. (I used to tell a joke when I spoke to personal computer executives, but I stopped telling it because they never laughed. The joke was this: “You people Jove standards. You have so many of them.” And they’d all nod and congratulate themselves—yes, we have lots of standards—but of course that was what was driving consumers crazy...nothing ever seemed to work with anything else.)\n\nNow, however—while powerful industries or companies may still try to impose their own proprietary standards for competitive advantage— the clear direction of the global Internet is toward open standards. And as we add another billion Internet users over the next decade, as well as who-knows-how-many physical objects with their own IP addresses, the drive for universal standards will be all the more unstoppable. And what that means is that suddenly it will become much easier for very large scale networks to come together, exchange information and interoperate, asnaturally as the standardization of physical construction materials makes large-scale construction projects far easier to manage. The result over the next 20 years will be the gradual growth of what will literally be a thin film of intelligence and connectivity all across the planet, taking the notion of smart buildings, smart cars, smart infrastructure to an entirely new, interconnected level. In the short term, in fact the big question is how much existing infrastructure can be retrofitted to take advantage of it. The idea, for example, of “smart” highway systems that somehow direct and maximize the efficiency of traffic by communicating with smart cars is compelling, but how long will it take to make smart cars even 50 percent of the vehicle population? Even with this caveat about retrofitting existing infrastructure, I think literacy about software and data will become part of civil engineering— not just the pluses (and minuses) of using automated design tools, but software and networking as almost literally another kind of building material. Civil engineers may find themselves forced to weigh in on a topic that’s currently under discussion in software engineering circles: at what point are software applications so mission-critical that programmers should be licensed to insure public safety? Is there any potential show-stopper in this vision of a very smart, networked infrastructure busy doing everything from conserving energy and controlling traffic to helping buildings survive hurricanes? Perhaps one, which is the issue of handling complexity in software."

        "The hardware world has managed to stay on the Moore’s Law treadmill with consistently astonishing results. When Gordon Moore suggested\n\nit in 1965, there were about 30 transistors on a chip. Intel confidently expects to reach 10 billion by 2010. But software has most definitely not kept pace. As software programs reach millions of lines in length, the opportunities for error or unforeseen interactions seem to rise proportionally. In a related development, as the use of the Internet for increasingly sophisticated business transactions increases, so do the level and intensity of security issues. Both of these issues—dependability and security—will need to be carefully addressed in the next decade before software truly becomes an elemental building block of infrastructure. So we’re nearly at the end of my extended metaphor about the automobile’s impact on infrastructure in the previous century—and that of information technology in the current. But there is one last vestige of the automobile to address: our on-going and almost certainly accelerating low-grade energy crisis. As Chinese and Indian consumers enter the middle class and their countries begin to dominate the oil market, we are almost certain to experience an increasing number of intermittent energy disruptions. None, I suspect, will be so lengthy or severe that anything more than incremental urgency is added to alternative energy development. That’s partly due to increasingly short- term planning by both government and corporations: alternatives are likely to remain less than fully funded, and there will be relatively few structural encouragements to mass commercialization. And the United States, in particular, may not be capable of the massive new capital expenditures that large-scale energy conversion would require, so sticking with a known—even if often painful—economic reality becomes the inevitable choice. Conservation efforts, such as fuel-efficient hybrid automobiles and smart use of energy conservation techniques in construction will probably provide the greatest technologic impact on energy consumption. Hydrogen will remain stuck in the R&D category due to its initial reliance on hydrocarbons and infrastructure costs. The various forms of solar will continue to proliferate on a piecemeal basis, although advances in material science will particularly drive down photovoltaic costs. And nuclear energy has already begun a resurgence that will accelerate mildly with increasing public concern over energy costs and promotion of safer plant technology. In short, due to global demand, I believe that energy supplies will be stretched to the maximum for decades to come, and for the most part, we will learn to live with it. However, there’s one big implication: the largest single game-changer in the progress and direction of technology between now and 2025 would be a sudden, major disruption in energy supplies that lasts for several years and appears not to be easily remedied. What could cause this? Consider the possibility of a small-scale nuclear exchange in the Middle East that rendered a portion of that region’s oil supply unusable for decades. After confirmation of the oil-fields’ long-term unavailability, we would see a national—and likely global—“Manhattan Project” to remake the world’s energy sources. The first beneficiary would be thenuclearindustry, via a new generation of “fail-safe,” rapidly-deployable compact nuclear plants. At the same time, both hydrogen and fusion research would see a flood of new funding. Photovoltaic, at that point, will be economically manufactured in large and flexible sheets and could become a standard roofing material in the southern portions of the United States. Fully retooling the power grid with uniform connectivity and the software support for distributed power generation will be a multi-year project with dozens of vendors. And every aspect of energy efficiency—from new light-weight materials to high-temperature superconductors—will suddenly be shifted to the front burner. In this scenario the technology climate will resemble a country on war footing, with concentrated government support of relevant research, tax incentives for adoption, and benign or active neglect of other sectors. (Commercial television, for example, set to launch in 1941, was frozen until after WWIL.,) It will likely be a time of remarkable ferment and invention, as so many promising alternative energy concepts have arisen over the years only to be economically overshadowed by the incumbent sources. While the abrupt demise of the world’s petrochemical foundations would bea calamity of the first order, it would also produce some remarkable new opportunities and technology breakthroughs. So now let me transition from that very hypothetical scenario to another—the next generation—that is anything but hypothetical. But before I talk about the characteristics of that generation, let me talk for a moment about their numbers. We’ve all heard that the future in most of the developing world portends an older population and a dearth of younger workers. What isn’t as often observed is that the United States will continue to be the fastest-growing industrialized country on earth. The forces are already in play for a 46 percent population increase by 2050, and little in the next three decades will substantially change that. That means nearly 100 million additional bodies by mid-century—with 30 million more before the end of this decade. And the wheels are already in motion: the 2000 census counted more than 52 million kids in elementary and secondary school, the largest number in U.S. history—just beginning their cycle of consumption and family formation. The United States is a perfect storm for population growth, between increasing life expectancy, a liberal immigration policy and teenagers who continue to dream of families with 2.2 kids. What that means over the next few decades is that all fixed resources will grow increasingly valuable and scarce—especially land. My friends who grew up in New York City marvel at the fact that the little beach cabins that their middle- class parents owned out in the Hamptons now sell for $2 million each. And my friends with Ivy League educations all agree that with current competition, there’s no way they could get into their alma maters today. But of course both conditions exist simply because they’re not making any more beachfront property or Ivy League institutions—but there are a lot more citizens who want them. The same is going to prove true of our favorite transportation system as well. We’re building more roads—but there’s no way we can keep up with the number of people who want to use them. And in fact must use them, as increasing land prices force them further and further out into the exurbs to find affordable housing. In the last full study, in 2003, traffic congestion cost Americans 3.7 billion hours of time and 2.3 billion gallons of wasted fuel. I think it’s fair to say that when you factor in costs like congestion and pollution, even if you assume some real breakthroughs in efficient vehicles, the total social cost of moving people around is going to continue to rise—while the cost of moving information around is, as we saw early, plummeting. And this leads me directly to the unique characteristics of the next generation, whom I suggest are already evolving to face the world they will inherit. Thenext generation is the first to grow up never knowinga world without the Internet and without interactive media and communications. Some of their adaptations—multi-tasking, for example, or the desire for customized media via iPods and TiVo—are things that most of us can at least partly identify with. But there’s one element that I think is truly foreign to many adults. I have a friend in Silicon Valley, in his forties, who is an engineer for Google—which is about the coolest job in Silicon Valley right now—and who also has an understanding of the Internet that’s second to none. But he can’t understand his 14-year-old son, who every night finishes dinner and goes upstairs, to play a massively-parallel online game with his best friend—who lives just next door, and is upstairs in his own bedroom, playing right along. Each evening and on weekends the two are “shoulder to shoulder” in the online world, talking to one another through microphones and earpieces. But they go to different schools and actually rarely ever see each other “in real life.” Nonetheless, they consider each other best friends. That to me is one of the remarkable capabilities we will see continue in this generation—the ability to form meaningful virtual relationships and successful virtual collaborations that for most intents and purposes are as substantial as those their parents had in the real world. This generation is about social networks that are held together with constant electronic connectivity. A recent sociological study of teens in Japan and Finland, for example—two countries where teen use of mobile phones and “texting” is almost universal—shows that the technology has fundamentally changed the way they plan their days. Instead of deciding at the end of the school day that everyone will meet at, say, the pizza parlor at 7:00 PM, they continue to text back and forth the rest of the afternoon, and all just more or less converge at the pizza parlor as the plans evolve. And more strikingly, if one of the group doesn’t actually get there right at 7:00, but continues to text, then he’s considered to have “arrived” nonetheless. What this means, I think, is that this next generation will be extremely good in virtual workgroups—but virtual workgroups well beyond the kind of simple online collaboration we think of today. The best example I can think of is an experiment some years ago at Xerox PARC—the fabled birthplace of so much personal computer and network technology. The PARC researchers decided to study what would happen if you were able to fully connect two distant worksites with a high bandwidth connection constantly transmitting audio, video, text, graphics—anything that would fit through a wire. The result was this: you’d walk into the coffee lounge in Palo Alto and it would look like an ordinary coffee lounge—a table, some chairs—but on one wall was a huge video screen, showing another coffee lounge, only this one was in Portland, Oregon. An infrared body heat detector would ring a bell in the Portland lounge, letting them know someone was “there”, and after a moment someone might wander onto the screen, nearly big as life, holding their coffee cup. And so you’d casually chat with your Portland colleague over coffee and after a while you’d both go back to your offices, five hundred miles apart. This metaphor of constant connectivity was carried out throughout the facilities—cameras and screens and microphones everywhere. What the researchers then did was divide a project into two pieces, have half done in one site and half in the other. A team of work sociologists monitored the progress and at the end determined that basically the work had been done as if all the participants were in the same physical space. That, to me, is a remarkable finding—but all the more believable now that the next generation is showing its skills at virtual collaboration. And what I think that means is that we’ll see an explosion of setups like the Xerox PARC work, only with far more advanced technology. Already\n\nplaces like MIT and the National Institutes of Health are creating very sophisticated virtual conference spaces—some even equipped with software that can automatically sense who at a conference table is speaking and bring their image to the fore onscreen. A Canadian team is using the same technology but adapting it for high-definition video, an inevitable next step as bandwidth costs drop. This generation’s ability for virtual collaboration will lead almost inevitably to a natural embrace of globalization. I learned this early on a few years ago when I was the editor and general manager of Newsweek."

        "com. One day we received a request from watchmaker Patek Philipe, for an online banner ad that would show, on five of their watch faces, the time in five world capitals. I wanted to make sure those watches were accurate, so I asked my programmer, who was about twenty-two at the time, if he could write some code that would go out on the Internet and set the displays to the signals from the atomic clock in Colorado. “That’s a little tricky,” he said."
    ],
    [
        "“Can I hire a freelancer?” Sure, I said, but don’t break the bank. Two weeks later he came back with the ad and it not only worked beautifully but was done very elegantly, with the bare minimum of code used. I said I’d like to meet the guy who did this. “Well,” my programmer hesitated, “I’m not sure that’s possible.” Why not, I wondered? “Well, he kind of lives in Moscow.”\n\nWhat my young programmer had done was go out on the Internet to look for a freelancer and simply hired the best and cheapest one he could find. Then it hit me: How did we pay this fellow? “Uh,” said my employee, “he wanted American dollars, in cash. So you know that sealed pouch that goes to the Newsweek bureau in Moscow? I just put it in there and he came into the office and picked it up.”\n\nWho knows what currency laws we might have been violating there, but the point is clear: my young programmer, as he grows up and rises through the ranks, is never going to think twice about employing someone on the other side of the planet. And there will be plenty of people for him to choose from, because one side-effect of the Internet on the next generation globally is what I call the democratization of information. Two decades ago a friend of mine used to make money by air-freighting the latest American programming manuals to Europe, where the books wouldn’t come out for another few months. Now, of course, you can download tutorials on the most advanced kinds of Java programming anywhere from Minneapolis to Mombasa. Asa result, it’s not news that first call centers and now programming jobs are increasingly shipped overseas. But the democratization continues: Reuters is outsourcing more and more of its reporters to Bangalore, and it’s already possible to have extensive amounts of American legal research done far more cheaply overseas. And some American medical students are already declining to pursue radiology as a specialty, as digital radiography allows the outsourcing of x-ray reading to places like Ireland and Australia. When you consider the nature of civil engineering and its specialties in 2025, I’d suggest as much latitude as possible when considering how elements of the work could end up distributed around the planet. Finally, let me take amoment to speculate a bit about the impact of this highly interactive environment on the next generation’s education and cognition. Of course, in terms of the future of civil engineering, the decline in U.S. math and science skills undoubtedly remains the number one challenge, particularly when youth overseas—newly empowered by the democratization of information—see math and science as the surest stepping stones to lucrative employment. It still baffles me that we remain the only industrialized nation that lets six graders say, “I don’t really get math,” and proceeds to more or less let them slide—resulting in a mass of college freshmen who find that their entry barred to the many career opportunities whose prerequisite is a comfortable relationship with mathematics. As a result, I’m afraid, we end up with vastly more than our global share of lawyers. Clearly, the effort required to retool the national attitude toward math and science is something more than merely tweaking the educational system. It has as much to do with cultural expectations, work ethic, and the social image of science and engineering. One might hope that the recent media popularity of the “computer geek” would be an impetus to changing the situation, but thus far—even though “geekdom” has managed to create the richest man on earth—it doesn’t seem to have had a commensurate impact on science and engineering enrollment. More broadly, however, I’m also concerned about how the interactive media that is becoming dominant for the next generation can affect attention span, concentration, and reading abilities. The multi-tasking that commentators often admire in young teens—the ability to watch television, instant-message, and do their homework simultaneously— has in other contexts now also been dubbed “continual partial attention.” In other words, the electronic environment has created a situation in which no one is fully paying attention to any one thing at a time. It may well be the case that the ability to concentrate fully on one problem or piece of information at a time may be a skill that we’ll need to teach in years to come. Of greater concern to me is the future of reading. The Internet, as it currently exists, is definitely a text-driven medium, but it’s a medium that’s about short-form reading. Not much exists in longer than 50 or 100 word bursts of information—nor does instant messaging or e-mail encourage lengthy constructions. (Indeed, write an e-mail longer than one hundred words or so and you can be almost guaranteed that some of the recipients will fail to read the last sentences.)\n\nAs a result, I think the ability to read and write long-form text—tracts longer, say, than a few hundred words—may well diminish in the next generation. A decade or two hence, when most text is presented electronically, it will be a simple matter to have everything read aloud. And advances in voice recognition and automatic sentence parsing will ultimately mean that computers will likely be able to turn dictation into better prose than can the speaker himself or herself. So the workplace need for long-form reading will decline, and so will those who practice it. Some lucky subset of the population—those with dedicated parents and (probably) an inborn neural facility with abstract language—will still develop long-form literacy, and thus also inherit the considerable intellectual and organization skills that reading instills. This elite will likely have a considerable strategic advantage over the rest of the population with more limited literacy. One way I think of this is that in a decade or so, probably every kid will graduate from high school knowing how to edit digital video, but only one in 20 will be able to write a 120-page script. At this point I fear that I’m starting to sound less like a futurist than an old fogy. But if there is anything I learned in 20 years of helping The Washington Post and Newsweek move into the 21\" century, it’s that in the end, the fundamentals still apply. A few years ago some technologists thought we could get rid of editors—that smart software would do the work of ranking and sorting and displaying stories, all customized to the reader’s personal taste. But it turned out that a bit of that went a long way, and ultimately audiences preferred that an editor’s hand remain behind the scenes rather than merely a sophisticated algorithm. More recently some commentators argued that through Weblogs and community journalism, we could get rid of professional reporters, and let the individuals closest to the stories do the reporting. Already it’s becoming obvious that it’s not so. The tools and roles of editors and reporters are changing, as is their relationship to the audience, and it would be foolish to pretend otherwise. But the more things change in our field, the more we find that the fundamental skills of the profession still apply. Thus if over the\n\nnext two days you find yourselves returning to the fundamental skills and attributes of your profession as you gaze out toward 2025, that’s not inappropriate. And if you also find yourselves describing some changes with perhaps just a touch of regret or even sadness, that’s not inappropriate either—because in the future, when something is gained, something else is often lost. The best example I ever saw of that was when I first came to Silicon Valley as a writer."

        "I was there to write a novel, rather than non-fiction: young people changing the world, making vast fortunes, seemed a perfect topic. When you write a novel you do much of the same research as for non-fiction, but you also need to get to know the personalities. So I gave quite a few dinner parties. At one of these dinner parties the guest of honor was an older gentleman who had already made a tidy fortune in the personal computer industry and was understandably optimistic about the future. Everyone else was from a more liberal arts background—a lawyer, a university professor, a doctor. After dinner my friend from Silicon Valley mentioned that he’d built a new mansion in the hills above Silicon Valley, and had installed audio light switches—“Turn on,” and the lights turn on, “turn off,” and the lights turn off. These were quite advanced for their day and my friend was fascinated by them, as was his five-year-old grandson, who came for a visit and understood audio light switches right away. But then he was sent off to the other set of grandparents’ house, who did not have audio light switches. The first night they found the little five-year-old standing in a darkened hallway, shouting up at the light: “Turn on! Turn on!”\n\nMy friend finished that story, leaned across the table and said “That is a young man who will grow up believing anything is possible!” And there was silence around the table, and I know what everyone else was thinking: That’s a young man who will grow up not knowing how to turn on the lights. Somewhere in there, between my friend’s great optimism about what the future might bring, and everyone else’s real fear of what might be lost in the process, is where I suspect the process of vision-building begins. And with that, I wish you all the best of luck in your endeavor. Future Think: Is the Future Any Harder to See Than the Present? John G. Voeller\n\nSenior Vice President, Chief Knowledge Officer, Chief Technology Officer\n\nBlack & Veatch\n\nThe future of civil engineering two decades from now is equal parts of four roles, all of which are part of the civil engineering world today, but the elements of which must be very different in many ways. Though the general tendency is to assume a high technology or “Buck Rogers” aspect to such futures that is only a minor part. More importantly, even within the technology elements of the civil engineering future, most of those who predict such things have extremely checkered track records. A way to prevent this problem is to examine some basic precepts and foundation elements that are largely immutable over time and are generally inescapable regardless of the enterprise. These include\n\nPopulation Ubiquity Energy-less Geography Skilled Labor People-less Resources Borderless Attention-less Stability Scarcity Mutant-ful Access Organic Omni-talking Environment Autonomous Lingui-equal Technology Self-repairing Micro-value Healthcare\n\nIf we examine these elements, they imply the four roles. These include creator, repair person, integrator, and innovator. These roles have some common drivers and some unique, but all the elements listed map into these four roles very well. However, in order to play these roles, the civil engineers of tomorrow will not only have to change their knowledge, skills, teammates, and tools, they will have to be diligent if not aggressive about eliminating the desire to:\n\ne Do what they have done in the past;\n\ne Accept what is provided by labor and artisans as all that can be done;\n\ne Succumb to the limited imaginations of those that provide equipment, materials, and service; and\n\ne Suffer margins and market methods that prevent re-investment for self-improvement and optimization. If we look at simple examples like wireless technology, which is a mainstay of many future plans, the awareness of limits in capability today and those inherent in how such systems operate causes firms to presume too much and plan too aggressively. The reliance on a dramatic capability over the horizon presumes that those planning such systems are both solving problems and limitations that fit our needs or are even cognizant of the demands we will make on their systems in the far future. Examples like the major CTO's of communications companies not including the billions of inorganic participants we foresee in the next decade alone in communications is classic. Another area of danger in examining the future of the civil engineering in 2025 is the presumption that those upon which we depend are looking equally hard to embrace the future and provide value to us beyond today's limitations. This is in no way assured and within many elements of civil engineering there is a long and painful history of not pursuing the future because of limited investment funding, inability to attract venture support, unwillingness to embrace the future because the uncertainty suggests greater risk, and inability to integrate new capabilities into the civil engineering enterprise successfully and consistently. As ASCE and its members plan their individual, group, and profession futures, there are many methods to example the future strategically and build practical plans. However, most of these methods assume much shorter horizons and more specific outcomes that a two-decade horizon normally enables. The use of the roles and elements outlined in this presentation allow the kind of leapfrogging of micro-prediction and premature conclusions common in long-view thinking. It is critical that Summit participants be able to make such leapfrog distances within a structured thought process before they should accept any presumed outcomes of their visioning effort. Civil Engineering in 2025: Globalization Issues and Impacts\n\nRalph R. Peterson Chairman and CEO CH2M HILL\n\nThank you David, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. It is a privilege to be in such distinguished company, and I look forward to our important work over the next couple of days. Let me begin by commending the leadership of ASCE for having the courage and foresight to convene this ambitious—or perhaps audacious—Summit on the Future of Civil Engineering. Taking on the challenge of painting a picture of our profession in 2025, and then tackling the task of shaping aspirational visions of that future—visions, which can enhance the positive impact and the professional excitement of civil engineering and, indeed, of the engineering profession as a whole—is not for the faint of heart. But however ambitious, this is in fact a worthwhile and important undertaking. It can—and with the talented group ASCE has assembled for this Summit I believe it will—provide us with a compass of sorts—a compass that can give us important strategic bearings and direction for our profession’s journey forward. The future of our profession is going to happen. As David said, we can\n\neither react to unfolding events and external influences, or we can get\n\nto work on:\n\n—analyzing the influences and driving forces that will significantly shape our profession’s future,\n\n—articulating a realistic and achievable vision of the future we would like to create,\n\n—shaping our actions so as to vector our profession toward the future we “choose” instead of the future we simply “get”. ASCE has wisely chosen the latter path, and it starts with this Summit. My task is to get us started by taking a look at the issues and impacts of globalization on civil engineering and the engineering profession in 2025. This is intended to provide ideas and stimulus for the various breakout groups to drill into the implications and aspirations, which the topic of Globalization presents. Let me tackle that assignment by outlining five key and interconnected “global driving forces” that will shape the global context and parameters of our profession in the years ahead. We can then identify a handful of key globalization issues for our profession that emerge from the aggregate effect of these five driving forces. Finally, we will seek to extract a few key conclusions for all of this, with which to prime the pump for the more in-depth breakout discussions. The five global driving forces I present for your consideration are:\n\n= Communication and information technology serving as a profound driver of global business and economic change\n\n= Population and demographic shifts affecting our global civil engineering practice\n\n= Expanding trade and the emergence of democratized market economies, accompanied by heightened security concerns\n\nWorldwide industry and organization consolidation\n\n= Natural resource and environmental limitations affecting global growth and infrastructure\n\nAs we shall see, these forces are interrelated. We will look at them one at a time, and then as noted try to draw some conclusions about their aggregate effect on our professional practices, infrastructure development, and what kind of world we create for future generations. Communication and Information Technology\n\nI must begin my chronicle of global driving forces by addressing communication and information technology, even though John Voeller will provide a much broader and more comprehensive discussion of the topic of “technology” in his upcoming presentation. I will carefully avoid intruding into John’s subject matter, but two aspects of technology—communication information technology and CAD/CAE—have the profound effect of magnifying and/or facilitating virtually all of the other global driving forces I will address. It is communication IT that makes national boundaries extremely permeable—those same national boundaries that have historically insulated nation-states from global change drivers and external influences. It is communication IT that enables and facilitates an accelerating transformational web of trade and finance relationships. It is communication IT that lubricates industry consolidation and reshaping of the global corporate landscape. It is communication IT that has helped to expand and empower non- governmental organizations (NGO’s), thereby, allowing civil societies across the globe to organize around issues of common concern and to share the global governance stage with national governments and multi-national corporations. It is communication IT that allows global sourcing of labor (including engineering), as well as equipment, supplies, and material. When we add the consideration of integrated 3-D/4-D CAD/CAE information technology together with the communication IT aspects, we get an IT impact on our profession in the coming years that is truly a Richter-scale event. A good illustration of the profound effect of this “integrated IT” catalyst on our profession can be seen in the FIATECH “Capital Projects Technology Roadmap.” The vision model for the Technology Roadmap integrates nine functional elements of the life-cycle capital projects—ranging from planning through automated design, real-time project management, procurement and supply, integrated information management, and operations. Most of these elements exist today, but their eventual integration—as contemplated in the Technology Roadmap—will accelerate transformations in our industry, which have already begun in fits and starts. The trend toward integrated project delivery—including design/build, DBO and PPP’s—is here already but will accelerate as IT tools (such as 3- Dand 4-D design tools) are refined and—more importantly—integrated with a life cycle focus. Think about what integrated cyber-connectivity will soon mean in terms of shortened cycle times, increased procurement and supply chain synergy, global sourcing, and operations/facility management. We’re looking at not just a vastly different playing field; we’re looking at a new project delivery ball game. Value creation through project integration: that’s the idea we’re talking about here, and it will be a really big deal. Population and Demographic Shifts Affecting Our Global Civil Engineering Practice Let me continue this examination of key global driving forces with\n\na look at some population and demographic impacts upon our engineering community. Over the course of my 40-year engineering career, we always seemed to be asking the same question in one form or another: “Where will tomorrow’s engineers come from?” But most of the firms I talk to today—and I’m not talking about just here in the United States, but all around the world—are identifying the availability of engineering talent—engineering “human capital”—as a rate-limiting factor of truly urgent proportions. As described in the National Academy’s “Gathering Storm” report released last October, and elsewhere, there are plenty of reasons for companies and agencies who are largely dependent on U.S. engineering resources to worry (this is true for all U.S. engineering resources, but especially so for civil engineers): declining numbers of engineering graduates; an aging engineering workforce; under- representation in the profession by women and the minority communities that are the fastest growing segment of the future college- age population; global cost/pricing pressures, which drive down the attractiveness of our profession to new entrants; and a disturbing trend toward “commoditization” of A&E services, which erodes innovation, creativity, and professional respect. When we look at this in a global context, we can see an engineering profession (and by inference a civil engineering profession) in 2025 that will be very different from that of today. Consider the following statistics, which focus on just one country: China. In 1985 the National Bureau of Statistics of China reported 73,000 first (BS) university engineering degrees granted throughout the nation. In the same year, according to the U.S. National Science Foundation, first university engineering degrees granted in the United States reached a peak of nearly 78,000, or roughly the same as China. Ten years later, the number of engineering degrees granted in China had more than doubled to nearly 149,000, while U.S. engineering degrees had declined to 63,000. By 2002, the number of engineering degrees reported in China had more than tripled from 1985-levels to 252,000, while U.S. degrees leveled off to a NSF reported 61,000. I know there have been questions about the accuracy and comparability of China engineering degrees (the “Gathering Storm” report cited 600,000 engineering degrees in China in 2004. We now know that figure includes many sub-baccalaureate degrees and is not comparable to the U.S. engineering degree statistics with which we are familiar.) In any event, I believe the numbers cited above are in the ballpark and are directionally correct; they clearly indicate that over the next 20 years\n\nChina alone will add something over four times the number of engineers to the global engineering workforce as will the United States. Now factor in other countries such as South Korea (about 65,000 engineering graduates in 2002, up from 25,000 in 1985) and India (data unclear but big numbers—and growing), and the rest of the world, and extrapolate to 2025. We're talking about a global workforce that is even more highly interconnected, and really different from today. What is clear is that the historical influence of American (and other developed country) civil engineers on the world stage will diminish as a globalizing engineering workforce is affected by the twin effects of the sheer numbers of developing country engineers, and accelerated developing country economic clout. Another population trend that tilts the engineering leadership scale outside the United States is the worldwide movement toward urbanization. Sometime in the coming year, for the first time in history, the world is expected to be made up of more urban dwellers than rural ones. And by the year 2030, more than 60 percent of the world’s people, or nearly 5 billion of us, will live in cities. Where that urban growth will occur is even more significant. Of those 5 billion urban dwellers on Earth in 2030, more than half will reside in Asia. Little wonder that 80 percent of the infrastructure to be developed on the planet over the next 20 years is forecast to occur outside the United States. When you add it all up:\n\ne Asmaller portion of engineers originating from the United States and other industrialized countries\n\ne Urbanized development and infrastructure growth concentrated in the developing world\n\ne Larger more youthful workforces residing in Asia, Africa, and Latin America\n\ne Allstirred by wealth-generating economies in robust emerging nations\n\nOne can see that the United States/developed country civil engineer in 2025 will be part of a truly global and multi-cultural profession in which there is probably no “dominant” culture of “national standards” influence. Everybody will need to learn from one another’s experience because new and exciting projects will be going on everywhere. Adaptability to and respect for different cultures will be valued in a world where global sourcing and multi-disciplinary teams are the norm. Expanding Trade, Democratization, and Heightened Security\n\nLet us now shift our focus to the driving force of expanding trade, democratization, and their countervailing companion of upholding national and institutional security. At the close of the 20\" century, nearly two out of three people living on the Earth, (3.9 billion of us) lived under some form of democratic tule. Compare that to the start of the 20\" century, when only 25 nations or just 12 percent of world population lived under what could be called democratic rule. By mid-century, still less than half the world population (42 percent) lived under some form of democracy. But today, electoral democracies now represent 120 of the 192 existing countries and constitute 63 percent of the world’s population. Clearly, “democracy’s century” as some have described the 20\" century, has delivered us to a doorstep of hope, freedom, and economic promise for the entire world. But meanwhile, lurking at our back door, and occasionally breaking and entering, stands the threat of global terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and those fundamentalist forces opposed to seeing democracy and market economies take root. As democracy has expanded across the globe, it has been accompanied\n\nby robust trade and economic growth. For those of us old enough to\n\nexperience the past half-century, the transformation we’ve witnessed of the trade and economic profile of our planet is nothing short of staggering. e The world population—now some 6.5 billion people—has more than doubled since 1950. e World GDP has increased eight-fold over the same 50-plus years reaching more than $U.S. 40 trillion in 2004. e World trade has increased 14-fold over roughly the same period of time, so trade is a growing part of global GDP. e Foreign direct investment, which reached $1.3 trillion in year 2000, is now more than seven times as large as governmental (“official”) fund flows. e Foreign exchange trading—flows of money rather than trade of goods and services—is much more than an order of magnitude larger than the cross-border trade of goods and services. So the world, in my lifetime, has clearly moved into a finance-driven web of trade relationships that interconnect national economies. This affects all nations, their people, their businesses, and their institutions, because all are part of this web. This, coupled with the emergence of just-in-time global supply chains, has created enormous economic\n\nopportunity but also heightened vulnerabilities—related to both security issues and natural disasters—from this global web. Worldwide Industry and Organization Consolidation\n\nClosely linked with this global shift in finance and trade activity, and facilitated by the IT cyber connectivity comes the fourth of the driving forces I said I would cover, that being the consolidation and globalization of corporations and industries. To give you a picture of the force of the economic current toward global, industry consolidation, alookatthe 150 largest economic entities (based on value-added, not revenues) on our planet is revealing. As of 2004, the majority of those entities are not nation states, but transnational corporations. A full 63 percent or 95 of those largest economic entities are corporations. And the trend toward a global-scale, corporate business model is expanding across business sectors and geographies. The engineering and construction industry is by no means immune to this consolidation trend. E&C industry analyst, Paul Zofnass, did an interesting study of consolidation among firms involved in the civil infrastructure business (mainly water, transportation, and environmental firms) a couple of years ago. The Zofnass analysis identified 31 firms that had 1997 revenues of $200 million or more. By 2004, 14 of the 31 had disappeared—either through consolidation/ takeovers or financial failure. To see how this E&C industry consolidation is taking shape, take a look at what’s happening among the ENR Top 500 Design Firms. A glance at the Top 25 firms shows just how much of the industry is concentrated at the top. The largest 25 firms—that’s five percent of the firms... accounted for 49 percent of industry revenues in 2005. A decade ago that figure was just over 40 percent of industry revenues, so the concentration is concentrating over time. Theemergence of very large trans-national/multi-national corporations carries some big implications in the context of the driving forces involving democratization and governance. The power, influence, and social significance of these multi-national corporations (MNC’s) begins to rival that of nation-states, which means corporations increasingly share the stage with national governments (and NGO’s) in the realm of global policy and governance. Surveys show that public trust in these MNC’s is very low, with the result that companies who demonstrate strong ethics and transparency will enjoy a comparative advantage when it comes to working with civil society and government regulators to get the “social licenses” needed for our projects. This is the world in which we will practice as civil engineers in 2025. Natural Resource and Environmental Limitations Affecting Global Growth and Infrastructure\n\nLet me now turn to the last of the driving forces that will shape our profession in 2025: natural resource and environmental limitations on global growth and provision of infrastructure. The global population now tops 6 billion people—and is on its way to 8 billion over the next 20 years. Economic growth in the developing countries (where half of the world’s population lives on a GDP of $2/day or less) is generally accelerating, with China and India being notable examples where GNP growth rates of 5 to 7 percent are common. Meanwhile, economic growth in the developed countries continues at a long-term annual rate of about 2.5 to 3 percent. The effect of the twin pressures of population growth and economic growth will be to require about one new planet’s worth of natural resources, energy, and environmental carrying capacity in the next 20 years. In this new century, we have already entered an era in which natural resource constraints (raw materials, water, energy, and environmental carrying capacity) begin to show upas rate-limiting factors for economic growth. And that will have an increasingly significant impact on the way design professionals, and our clients and construction partners, think about and approach projects in the built environment. I remain convinced that the issue of sustainable economic development will become a future competitive factor for the civil engineering profession. In addition, “sustainable” economic growth ultimately includes not just an environmental dimension but also a social equity dimension. Poverty alleviation and the provision of at least a basic quality of life is a key prerequisite for truly sustainable economic growth. Improving the quality of life for people is also the strongest foundation for global security I can imagine, and basic civil infrastructure is what actually provides that improved quality of life. This situation represents a golden opportunity for civil engineers in 2025 to emerge with two defining attributes, which will enhance the\n\npositive impact, respect, and excitement for our profession:\n\ne civil engineers as effective stewards of the natural resources and environmental assets needed to drive sustainable economic growth\n\ne civil engineers as providers of the basic infrastructure that gives real meaning to idea of improving people’s lives and prospects\n\nLet me close with some summary observations about how I believe these change drivers will, in the aggregate, impact our civil engineering profession. e Notwithstanding the current geopolitical turbulence of military conflict, security concerns, and some §anti-globalization backlash, I remain convinced that the next two decades will on balance see a continuation of expanding global trade, expanded democratization, continued “marketization” of economies, which are not democratically ruled (such as China), and continued globalization and consolidation of industries. This will occur in a more security-sensitive environment, and in a world of growing resource shortages (including especially water but also a wide array of mineral, natural, and energy resources). It will be characterized by cross-border environmental issues (such as climate change and fisheries depletion) that—compared to the “point source” pollution issues we are accustomed to thinking about and regulating—are more complex in causation and insidious in effect. e This will yield a marketplace in which both the opportunities and the competition are global. It will be a marketplace with new rules of engagement, in which integrated life cycle project delivery (design, procurement, construction and, in some cases, project development/finance and operation) will be the norm and where risk transfer and prudent risk management will be of growing importance. Project delivery models will be shaped by increasingly powerful capabilities of integrated IT tools, which will begin to resemble the old “master builder” model. Civil engineers will have an expanded role in integrating the work of other engineering and design disciplines as well as the increasingly-integrated procurement and construction aspects. e Global sourcing of both professional talent and material will be a competitive imperative. Flexibility, adaptability, and the ability to work in a multi- discipline team environment will be highly valued. Winners will demonstrate respect and acceptance of different cultures and approaches. Licensure will become a contentious issue as national governments use licensure as a kind of non-tariff trade barrier in a futile attempt to maintain “control” over events. Procurement will be of particular importance because of global sourcing and concerns over supply chain stability arising from security and/or natural disaster disruptions. e The pressing reality of natural resource and environmental constraints on economic growth will become critical to the civil engineering profession. As both the developing and developed worlds strive to improve their economic prospects and quality of life, we will come to grips with the fact that we live in a finite world. The leadership challenge for our profession is to reposition ourselves as effective stewards of natural resources and the environment, and providers of that improved quality of life. e Civil society will become increasingly demanding in granting the “social license” required for our built projects. Stakeholder communication and collaboration will be as important as technical content."

        "e Ethical expectations will be high. Aseach ofthese realities comes into focus, there will bea tendency tothink of global economic growth as a kind of zero-sum game, in which the gain of one segment of our global society (i.e., one country, or one region) must be a loss for another segment. But the magnificence of engineering and the design professions is that they are capable of creating a non-zero sum game for our planet’s economic growth—making more for all by ingenuity and creative resource utilization and reuse. Engineering is the profession, which is most capable of creating “non-zero sumness”—of making the pie bigger instead of fighting over who gets smaller pieces, and civil engineering is the natural leader of that endeavor. That fact ought to be a source of pride and inspiration to us all. I truly do believe this idea of pursuing and creating non-zero sum solutions is a powerful notion both to guide our personal practices, and for the greater good of our clients and society at-large. As we look to the future we see a world where the global landscape is transforming the distribution of our profession’s power and influence in terms of relative economic and cultural clout, the numbers and geographic distribution of engineers, economic interconnectedness, and the big wild card of security. I will leave you with these aspirational thoughts on civil engineering in 2025, which I distill from this globalization chronicle:\n\n1. We are society’s master builder. We create value for our clients and society by integrating the life cycle elements of built project delivery. 2. We use ingenuity, creativity, and innovation to create whole projects that are more than the sum of their parts. We thereby ensure that economic growth is not a zero-sum game. 3. We make efficient resources utilization and environmental stewardship an integral part of the built environment. 4. Our high standards for ethical conduct include zero tolerance for bribery or corruption. Thank you for your time and attention."

        "Leadership\n\nHenry J. Hatch Lt. General (Retired)\n\nGood afternoon. I have the privilege of introducing the third discussion topic, leadership. When invited to do so I initially assumed that the topic was leadership in the classic sense of civil engineers leading people, individually and organizationally, in the year 2025. As interesting as that would be, we will not discuss leadership in that context, but leadership by the profession in a public role in the theme areas of professional practice, infrastructure, and environment. I would point out that to have an effective public role, civil engineers, as a profession, must adopt that role as integral to their profession. We have not done that yet, at least not to the extent other professions have. For ASCE this is certainly a high-priority topic in the current develop- ment of ASCE’s next strategy. In the current draft environmental scan for professional strategic issues, the top listed issue is this one:\n\n“Years of deferred infrastructure investment and maintenance, and the profession’s limited effectiveness in communicating with public officials regarding infrastructure needs:\n\na) Place public safety at risk. b) Hinder the nation’s economic growth and competitiveness.”\n\nThat issue focuses on one of our topics, infrastructure. You could add “and the profession’s limited effectiveness in communicating with the public on other issues as well such as professional practice and the environment.”\n\nBefore getting into the specific topics we should address in our breakouts, I'd like to take a few minutes to set a context for these discussions by taking a critical look at who we are and commenting on the pitfalls in extrapolating basically 20 years into the future based on past data points. I became an engineer because engineers not only do something— they get things done. Engineers translate dreams, ideas, hopes, and concepts into reality—enduring reality. Engineers are problem solvers, applying science and engineering to provide services or produce products and projects. To quote Herbert Hoover:\n\nIt is a great profession."

        "There is the fascination of watching a figment of the imagination emerge. . .to a plan on paper. Then\n\nit moves to realization in stone or metal or energy. Then it brings jobs and homes. . . Then it elevates the standards of living and adds to the comforts of life. That is the engineer’s high privilege. As I progressed through what is now the first 49 years of my career, I became less satisfied with being only an executor of work directed by others and extended my interest into the broader life cycle of what I, or my organization, or my profession was doing. I saw a need for engineers to reestablish themselves in the public and private processes that decided the what, the why, and the where of what we would do (the context), not just the how. Society needs our involvement. This is the essential, critical theme in Rich Weingart’s book Forks In The Road, and I believe is a key ingredient in accomplishing many of our shared objectives such as:\n\ne Increasing public awareness, understanding, and recognition of engineers. e Attracting increasingly diverse youngsters to science and engineering—first schooling, then careers. e Influencing public and private sectors decisions that promote prudent investment in infrastructure. e Promoting balance in decision making to insure that development is economically, socially, politically, culturally, and environmentally sustainable as well as technically. But first, who are we? Or what’s our image? Not only our image in the public’s mind, but perhaps our self-image as well. As a profession, we are generally known to be, and we consider ourselves, ethical. We’re honest, serious (at times humorless, or as some might say, dull), committed, more intelligent than the average (excessive humility is not one of our weaknesses), and we’re client/customer/mission focused. Generally, we’re somewhat apolitical, not as individual citizens necessarily, but as practicing professionals. We're left-brained, unemotional, logical, very prescriptive, and very predictable (perhaps that’s because we understand and apply the laws of nature, the laws of physics, and we follow laws, codes, and regulations precisely). Those are pluses, but what are the impediments to engagement in public issues? We tend to be exclusive, not inclusive, in our organizations and in many of our dealings."
    ],
    [
        "We often look down our nose at those we feel are less educated and that lack our innate intelligence and insight. We are often more interested in the individual parts of things than we are the whole in terms of scope and time—‘“don’t bother me with life-cycle consequences of that project or development, I’m only interested in designing the foundation, etc., etc.” We are apt to say, “this is not my responsibility, and someone else\n\nshould do that, particularly if the “something” is beyond the specific scope of the directed task at hand. On the other hand, some of these impediments are also, at times, our strengths."

        "We’re left-brained, unemotional in a very emotional world. We’re client/customer/mission focused almost exclusively (perhaps to a fault at times) and because we are apolitical we can have credibility in a partisan political world. Many public issues needing our input, or that impact our profession, are not partisan political issues at all. OK."
    ],
    [
        "So what? Given this hand, how can we possible play it and effectively serve society through engagement in public issues? I believe, among other things we should celebrate the involvement of those among us who are capable and willing to be involved—we should reward that involvement and we should support it. We should seek out among us those who have the talent, the commitment (and also a high pain threshold at times) to engage in this process and encourage their involvement. We can contribute our money and time to organizations (such as professional and industry associations) that represent our concerns. We should demonstrate and prove that our input is relevant and value added to the public discourse. We should talk with the public, not at them, and directly to decision-makers in ways they understand. It is important that we listen, speak, and write at the audiences’ level of understanding and sophistication recognizing what biases they have, the competing messages, and what paradigms we need to break or cut through to get our points across. Engineers are normally not known for simplifying the complicated so the average person can easily understand us. The public is deafened by the noise-level of competing messages. Everyone is competing for attention. We are relevant but does the public fully understand to what extent? Our logic can appeal to theirs and our emotion can appeal to theirs, if we are willing to show it! How many engineers consider it absolutely contrary to their basic values to be openly passionate on an issue? That fact alone takes us off the screen in a compete-for-attention world. We should apply our innate strengths: integrity, logic, commitment to purpose, and overcome our tendency to be dispassionate so we will be heard and welcomed as valuable participants in the public decision processes. Most others who take strong positions and are effective advocates begin with emotion to capture attention and then follow with some (perhaps faulty) logic. We normally begin and end with cold facts and logic—all we have to do is find somewhere deep down the passion and carry our messages forward in ways that will capture attention, imagination and support. As Michael Roberts said last night, “be a strong voice.”\n\nLarry Roth, ASCE’s Deputy Executive Director, gives a great presentation titled “Infrastructure as a Social Issue” that is a refreshing move to include the softer, more emotionally-appealing ramifications of our work beyond, say, technical and economic. In closing this part, might our vision include engaging in a sufficient level of activism in decision processes to provide balance to the debate? We can and must do this without subverting the basic values or virtues of our profession. If we fail to engage, we will continue to deny society and our clients the benefit of what we can provide them not only for today but also for tomorrow. I mentioned the dangers of extrapolating to 2025 based on past data points. An example is generational differences among the current and array of “generations.” You have all heard the sometimes humorous generalizations about the generations. There are many definitions of generational groups and I’ll use one (by Claire Raines) that divides us into four:\n\ne The Veterans, born before 1939. e The Baby Boomers, born between ’40 and ’59. e Generation X, born between ’60 and ’79. and\n\ne The Millennium Generation (or Generation Y), born after 1980. (The current or recent entrants into our workforce and those who will be the newer leaders in 2025)\n\nThese generational blocks are defined by birth year, not age, hence new ones are added as time moves on. Each has its own personalities based primarily on their times more than their parent’s times. That is, what was happening during their most impressionable years? A new generation is taking shape as we speak with the defining events we are now experiencing. I won’t try to define its characteristics, but think of the end of the Cold War, 9/11, Iraq, and Afghanistan and how those events are shaping, say, current 10 year olds. We might compare the personalities of the four I’ve labeled in such areas as outlook, work ethic, view of authority, how they view leadership, the nature of their relationships, and perspective. Time won’t allow that,\n\nbut I’ll mention two views of authority and leadership:\n\ne First, view of authority: veteran—respectful, baby boomer—love/ hate, generation X—unimpressed (you have to earn it!). e Second, leadership: veteran—by hierarchy, baby boomer—by consensus, generation X—by competence (“I will be led by whom | respect”). Is it any wonder there are inter-generational challenges in many organizations and in our profession? There was a very good piece entitled “Steps You Can Take to Hire, Keep, and Inspire Generation X’ers” in the Winter 2001 ASCE’s journal Leadership and Management in Engineering. That generation is now 27 to 46 years old, which brackets the average age in most engineering companies that are run by boomers and veterans. Alist of what the X’ers are saying might include appreciate us, be flexible, create a team, develop us, involve us, walk your talk, and lighten up. Why bother with this? By 2025 we will be able to define characteristics of at least one more generation beyond the millennium generation. Because there was no straight line joining these current four, extrapolating to the next one—generation Z—is impossible. It would be a worthwhile investment to try to define them, because they are the generation we are talking about in 2025 and we don’t know who they are. We won't try to do that today, but that uncertainty does suggest a need for adaptive and multi-scenario planning. Now to the breakouts—professional practice, infrastructure, and environment. The charge for each group starts with “Paint an aspirational picture of the public role the civil engineering profession in 2025 will play in ...(etc.)”\n\nFor professional practice it continues “... the definition, selection, and implementation of projects geared towards improving our natural and built environment, with sustainability being a key consideration and opportunity.”\n\nContinuing with professional practice for a moment, you might consider how can civil engineers take a more prominent role earlier in the life cycle of projects (or we should say, in the life cycle of meeting a need with or without a project). Pre-project life cycle roles might include the development of innovative technologies. How might civil engineers be more involved in the public and private decision processes that affect the practice of civil engineering? The former suggests direct engagement in the political process. Should civil engineers campaign\n\nfor full understanding by all stakeholders of the life cycle consequences and second and third order effects of short-term decisions? Should civil engineers embrace the notion of being the “master integrators?” What are the educational and business model ramifications? Should civil engineers seek to be leaders among their professional peers in such areas as public policy, public awareness, and understanding of engineering, and ethics? For the Infrastructure group the charge reads “Paint an aspirational picture of the public role the civil engineering profession of 2025 will play in considering the tradeoffs between alternative approaches to infrastructure decisions.” The charge seems to address three issues: what are the alternative approaches, who makes the decisions, and thirdly what is the civil engineers’ role? I believe the intent here is to focus on the built component of publicly-funded infrastructure. I say that because the Department of Homeland Security often reminds us that 85 percent of the nation’s critical infrastructure is in private ownership and the current common use of the term infrastructure (beyond civil engineers) is to refer to government infrastructure as systems such as the transportation system, which is more than roads, bridges, airfields etc., and includes the rolling stock and trucking companies and aircraft and the aviation industry. The trade offs among approaches might include privatization vs. public funding. Are there others? What role should stakeholders play? By stakeholders here I refer primarily to the benefiting public and the employed or contracted service provider. What must civil engineers do to be recognized as the best source of technical input to those defining issues, developing options, and setting priorities? How do engineers get effectively involved in the political process relating to public sector infrastructure decisions while adhering to their code of professional conduct? Will the “Report Card” approach be enough in 2025? What are the most effective and appropriate avenues for political action— professional societies, or trade and industry associations? And thirdly, the charge for the environment group is to “Paint an aspirational picture of the public role that the civil engineering profession will play in 2025 in balancing the needs of today and the environmental cost of the future.” I will take a little license here and rephrase the charge to say “...the public role that the civil engineering profession will play in meeting the needs of today without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.” Of course the reference here is the natural resources base upon which we and those in the future will depend. This is really the sustainability issue. It focuses on the environmental aspects of sustainability, but must, in my opinion, always be\n\nconsidered in the broader context of the other adverbs in the expression “environmentally sustainable development:” economic, social, cultural, political, and technical. The other adverbs have always been there and have driven decisions. The issue now is how do civil engineers work to insure appropriate weight is given the environmental or natural resources part of the equation? How do we develop a valid multidisciplinary approach to this? What innovative approaches can we take in the developed and developing world? They will certainly be different. Is this another leadership role for civil engineers among our professional colleagues? I asked David Mongan what my role here was and asked him if it was to “tee-up” the breakout discussions. He thought for a moment and said “you could look at it that way.” I later thought that it would be cruel to the golfers here to use a golfing term when some of you would rather be enjoying the beautiful golf course that surrounds us here at Landsdowne! Thank you..."

APPENDIX E\n\nProcess Used to Plan, Facilitate, and Follow-Up on the Summit\n\nThe idea of holding a Summit on the Future of Civil Engineering surfaced a number of years ago with detailed planning beginning in earnest in the summer of 2005. A Steering Committee (SC) of 17 was selected to plan, conduct, and report on the Summit. The individuals on the SC were chosen because of their past involvement in discussions about a Summit as well as their expertise in conducting strategic planning efforts and similar activities. A diverse group representing various elements of industry, government, academia, age, and gender was assembled. The first major task of the committee was to define the format for the Summit, which was determined to be a series of facilitated roundtables on various topics. The Summit would begin with an overall vision of the future provided by a noted futurist. Each roundtable would be preceded by a presentation on a specific topic and a concluding Summit activity would focus on crafting a series of visions. Parallel to the SC’s activities, the ASCE Foundation began an effort to raise the necessary funds to conduct the Summit. Stephen Bechtel, Jr. and Patricia Galloway were invited to serve as honorary co-chairs of the Summit. To support Summit planning, ASCE conducted an e-mail survey of the membership to determine their opinions on aspirations and visions for civil engineering in 2025. The actual Summit could only accommodate a limited number of individuals, so ASCE believed it was important to solicit the opinions of a wide selection of the membership in order to ensure broader input to the Summit discussions. ASCE received 4,382 valid responses to the survey. Respondents were demographically representative of the entire spectrum of the ASCE membership. The results included over 12,000 individual written comments submitted in response to the questions asked. The information was tabulated and used by the SC planning for the Summit. Asummary of the results of the survey is included in Appendix F. Invitations were extended to approximately 60 individuals selected to provide as diverse as possible representation at the Summit. The\n\nSC sought representation from large, medium, and small consultants; industry and government (both federal and local); academia; entities from other nations; technologists; architects; contractors; and younger members. Prior to the Summit, each invitee received four mailings of reports and other materials to help prepare them for the conference. See Appendix C for a list of the 51 invitees who, in addition to the SC, attended the Summit. A key factor in the Summit’s success was the use of ASCE staff as trained facilitators. In addition to the primary facilitator, a secondary facilitator served as a recorder. Facilitators prepared by reading the advance material sent to the Summit participants and by participating in training, which included separate mock facilitation sessions. The SC believed that the traditional process of having a report after each breakout by a member of each breakout group would not be effective. Having a recorder take real-time notes allowed the creation of theme teams. Each theme team consisted of four members of the SC and after each of the breakouts, a theme team met and, using the notes from the various breakout tables, compiled a consolidated report. That report was then presented to a plenary session for feedback and comments. This process was very effective and captured a great deal of information. Immediately after the conclusion of the Summit, the SC met to review the information and determine the next steps for writing the report. Writing and other tasks were assigned and a schedule for completion of the initial document was established. Once the draft report was completed, it was circulated to the Summit participants for their review and comment. Subsequent drafts were reviewed by a wider audience, both within and outside of ASCE. APPENDIX F Summary of Survey\n\nASCE Survey on the Future of Civil Engineering January 2006\n\nBackground and Methodology\n\nAs input to the Summit on the Future of Civil Engineering, ASCE conducted an electronic survey ofits membership. ASCE e-mailed to 43,075 demographically selected members on January 18, 2006 an invitation to participate in the survey and directions to the electronic survey site. Of these, 36,898 were successfully sent with 4,382 valid responses—a respectable 11.9 percent response rate. ASCE did not send a follow-up e-mail, and the survey site was available until February 1, 2006. The results of the survey were made available to the Steering Committee to Plan a Summit on the Future of the Civil Engineering Profession in 2025 (SC) to assist in the development of the program. By reviewing the results of the survey, the SC was able to ensure that the concerns of the membership at-large would be addressed during the Summit. There was no attempt on the part of the SC to pre-judge what should be considered an important issue for the Summit prior to the survey, but the SC did believe it was important to listen to the concerns of the collective membership prior to the Summit. In retrospect, the points of view of the Summit attendees, as judged by what they deemed to be important, was very similar to those of the survey respondents, who comprised a statistically valid sample of the overall ASCE membership. The important themes resulting from the Summit, such as leadership, respect, the infrastructure, and sustainability, were all identified by the survey respondents as being important to the future of civil engineering. Therefore, the SC was satisfied that the Summit attendees represented the attitudes and opinions of the overall ASCE membership. The survey had three (3) main parts:\n\n1. Demographic Information e Geographic Location e Area of practice e Civil engineering work experience e =©Age e Gender\n\n2. Questions 5 and 6 concerned the ranking or the perceived importance of suggested issues/developments/trends and factors influencing the choice of a civil engineering career. 3. Questions 7 and 8 were open-ended questions on issues/trends and aspirational visions. This summary report has three sections. The first section is the demographic profile of the respondents; the second, the cross- tabulation of the responses to questions 5 and 6 based on demographic information; and the third, the interpretation of the results of the open-ended questions. Survey Respondent Profile\n\nGeographic Location\n\nMore than 82 percent of the respondents live in the United States (see table below) and almost 18 percent outside the United States. Table F-1 All ASCE Count % % US 3,610 82.38 | 89.86 Intl 772 17.62 10.14 Total | 4,382 | 100.00 | 100.00\n\nThe overall makeup of ASCE membership is slightly different because 9.5 percent are international members. In previous surveys, ASCE international members have sometimes responded at a higher rate than domestic (U.S.-based) members. Area of Practice\n\nThe survey asked respondents to provide their area of practice, but the data did not allow for students to be broken out separately. While some students probably indicated “education,” some may have also placed themselves in what they considered their future category, so exact numbers cannot be quoted for this particular demographic area. With that caveat, the figures point to about half the respondents being in private practice, which correlates roughly with the overall ASCE membership breakdown. The apparent percentages of respondents from government (around 18 percent) and industry (around 12 percent) also show rough correlations with the general membership. Civil Engineering Work Experience\n\nTable F-2 Count % Civil Engineering Student 397 9.06 1-2 years 292 6.66 3-5 years 441 10.06 6-15 years 1,053 24.03 16-25 years 2,090 47.70 Nota civil engineer 85 1.94 No response 24 0.55 Total 4,382 100.00\n\nMore than 70 percent of the respondents have six or more years of civil engineering work experience. Age\n\nTable F-3 Count % All ASCE% 17-23 years 380 8.67 9.73 24-35 years 1,282 29.26 22.28 36-50 1,449 33.07 27.61 51-65 years 1,179 26.91 24.43 More than 65 years 74 1.69 15.96 No response 18 0.41 0 Total 4,382 100.00 | 100.00 Almost 60 percent of the respondents are between 24 and 50 years old, which is the age group of current civil engineers that is most\n\nlikely to be affected by the results of this Summit. Although the survey demographics do not precisely match the ASCE membership profile, the SC was satisfied that the respondents as a group are representative\n\nof the ASCE membership. Gender Table F-4 Count % All ASCE%\n\nMale 3,670 83.75 88.05 Female 693 15.81 10.63* No 19 0.43 1.32 response Total 4,382 100.00 | 100.00\n\nInterpretive\n\nThe table above shows the female participation in relation to the ASCE demographic mix. However, the Society’s gender field on applications or membership renewals is completed on a voluntary basis and for the most part is left blank, resulting in the percentage of males to females being interpretive. Thus, as represented by the Society’s membership database, the percentage of Society members listed as female is not\n\nstatistically valid. Summary of Responses to Questions 5 and 6\n\nQuestions 5 and 6 asked the respondents to rank a list of various issues that could impact the practice of civil engineering through 2025. These rankings were then tabulated according to the demographic categories identified in the previous section. Trends were then identified to determine what issues were important and to whom.

        "The only demographic groups that differed with this overall opinion were the international respondents and the students and members just starting out in their careers. (see Table F-6). For these groups, the ratings were reversed, with the international group ranking “Engineering ethics and business practice ethics” (R) ahead of the infrastructure (K) category, but behind natural disasters (L). Recent catastrophes (in relation to the Summit date), notably the tsunami in the Indian Ocean and the earthquake in the Kashmir region, which received a lot of international press, may have a lasting effect to the international respondents compared with U.S.-based respondents. ASCE’s periodic Infrastructure Report Card is directly related to the #1 issue in the minds of the U.S.-based civil engineers. Another interesting trend is the importance of the natural disasters category (L) relative to age. For both the age and experience demographic categories, the importance of this category declines with age, until they retire, and then it again gains in importance. Civil engineers are concerned with the “Number of civil engineers involved in the decision-making process for infrastructure policy” (B). More engineers will have to demonstrate a background in public policy decision-making and then seek employment that will permit them to have an effective voice in such decisions. Professional licensure (O) and engineering ethics (R) will continue to be important to civil engineers in the future, as evidenced by their relatively high standing in the survey. On the other hand, the respondents are less inclined to consider nano-technology (C) and bio-technology (J) as critical issues for the civil engineer of 2025. The following table presents a summary of the results with breakdowns by demographic categories."

        "To what extent do you believe the following factors would be important in making individuals more excited about a civil engineer in 2025? 1 = not important at all, 10 = extremely important\n\nA) Greater diversity in the profession\n\nB) Greater involvement in infrastructure policy-making\n\nC) More competitive pay in relation to other leading professions\n\nD) Greater public respect\n\nE) Less involvement in applying routine software design applications\n\nF) More respect from company management\n\nG) More opportunities to be leader of a project team\n\nH) Fewer hours worked per week\n\nI) More opportunities for researching and applying new civil engineering technologies\n\nJ) Broader and more extensive education before becoming a practicing civil engineer\n\nk) More leadership opportunities in community and national affairs\n\nL) Ability to advance to higher pay and stature in parity with senior management engineers while still doing design\n\nThe overall results for Question #6 for all respondents are tabulated in the following table. Table F-7\n\nMean | Summary of Overall Results for Question 6\n\n8.77 |C) More competitive pay in relation to other leading professions\n\n8.34 | D) Greater public respect\n\n7.95 | 1) Ability to advance to higher pay and stature in parity with senior management engineers while still doing design\n\n7.83 |G) More opportunities to be leader of a project team\n\n7.67 |B) Greater involvement in infrastructure policy-making\n\n7.66 | F) More respect from company management\n\n7.49 | 1) More opportunities for researching and applying new civil engineering technologies\n\n7.35 |K) More leadership opportunities in community and national affairs\n\n6.57 | J) Broader and more extensive education before becoming a practicing civil engineer\n\n6.48 | A) Greater diversity in the profession\n\n6.10 | E) Less involvement in applying routine software design applications\n\n5.96 | H) Fewer hours worked per week\n\nThe homogeneity of the responses to this question with respect to demographic categories is quite remarkable (see Table F-8). For all demographic categories the #1 factor is “More competitive pay in relation to other leading professions” (C), and the runner-up is “Greater public respect” (D). The third most important factor is “Ability to advance to higher pay and stature in parity with senior management engineers while still doing design” (L). Obviously, these three factors are interrelated. Leadership is also important as evidenced by the high rankings of “More opportunities to be leader of a project team” (G) and “Greater involvement in infrastructure policy-making” (B). On the other hand, hours worked is not important as evidenced by the last place ranking of “Fewer hours worked per week” (H). This was followed closely by “Less involvement in applying routine software design applications” (E). “Greater diversity in the profession” (A) was also ranked near the bottom when determining what factors would be important in making individuals more excited about being a civil engineer in 2025. The following table presents a summary of the results. The top five ranked items and the bottom three ranked items are presented along with their mean scores.

Question 7: This question asked of the respondent: “What do you\n\nthink will be the most important issues/developments/trends that will impact U.S. civil engineering and/or the U.S. civil engineer over the\n\nnext 20 years?”\n\nThe respondents were supplied space to provide three answers. This question was an open-ended version of questions 5 and 6; instead of being provided a list of items to rank, the respondents were given the opportunity to write in their own topic. Obviously, with thousands of responses, each of which is a phrase or a sentence, it is impractical to reproduce all of them in this summary. Even reproducing a small percentage of them would not necessarily be representative or meaningful. Therefore, it was decided to analyze all of them by using a word search tool that looked for key words or phrases. For instance, if the 2404 responses of 8a are searched for the word “lead,” then in addition to “lead,” the derivatives “leader” and “leadership” are also highlighted, as well as any other word with “lead” in it. This resulted in 505 occurrences that included some variation of the word “lead” out of the 2404 responses. The SC assumed that the frequency of these key words and phrases was indicative of the importance of these key word or key phrases in the responses to this question. This information was then used by the SC to ensure that key words, phrases, or concepts were factored into the planning and framing of the issues for the Summit. Not surprisingly, the responses to question 7 were very similar to the overall responses to questions 5 and 6 where “Maintenance of existing infrastructure” and “More competitive pay in relation to other leading professions” rated highest, respectively. The results for question 7 were as follows:\n\nKey Word or Phrase Number of Occurrences infrastructure 458\n\nsalary, pay, compensation level 210 education 154 sustainability, sustain 110 globalization, global 107\n\nfunding (for projects) 89\n\ndisasters 74\n\nlead, leaders, leadership 72 outsourcing, outsource 71\n\nQuestion 8: Question 8 consisted of six parts, all relating to various aspects of visions for civil engineers and civil engineering. The six starter statements and the number of responses to each are as follows:\n\n8a: laspire to a vision of civil engineers who will... (2404 responses)\n\n8b: lL aspire to a public that will... (2365 responses)\n\n8c: Laspire to a future in which civil engineering is... (2289 responses)\n\n8d: laspire to a vision of civil engineers who leverage technology by...

(1920 responses)\n\nAgain searching for key words, the results are as follows:\n\n8a: | aspire to a vision of civil engineers who will... (2404 responses)\n\nKey Word or Phrase Number of Occurrences\n\nlead, leader, leadership 505\n\nrespect, respectful 210\n\ndecision, decision maker 160\n\ntechnical 114\n\nvision, visionary 37\n\nteam, teamwork, team player 25\n\nWhile the number of responses in each table subgroup above and below\n\ndo not necessarily represent a statistically valid sample, one can try to draw some conclusions. For example, the respondents seem to believe the vision of civil engineering should include being a leader who is respected and is in a decision-making position. This was congruent with what was voiced at the Summit by the participants. 8b: | aspire to a public that will... (2365 responses)\n\nKey Word or Phrase Number of Occurrences respect, respectful 606 understand, understanding (what we do) 458 appreciate, appreciated 239 value (our services and our contributions) 213 importance (recognize and appreciate our role) 184 support 105\n\nThe respondents seem to want the public to understand and respect what civil engineers do and to appreciate the role that civil engineers play in the functioning of society. Judging by the comments, the respondents apparently do not believe that the public has a good understanding of how integral civil engineering is to everyday life. 8c."

        "Walesh, Consultant. APPENDIX H Vision: What It Is and Isn’t\n\nPrior to the Summit, the organizers researched and discussed the meaning of vision. Some vision definitions discovered during this process are:\n\n“A mental model of a future state of a process, a group, or an organization.””\n\ne “A cognitive image of the future, which is positive enough to members so as to be motivating and elaborate enough to provide direction for future planning and goal setting.”*\n\ne “Amental image of something that is not perceived as real and is not present to the senses” “...produced by the imagination.”*\n\ne “An image (not just an idea) of an attractive (compelling) future state unique to a group, organization, or community that gives meaning to effort [and] motivates people to work together in the turmoil of a changing world.”®\n\ne “A useful vision statement answers these questions: How will we be different or better? What new roles or areas will we cover? What new measures of success will we have achieved?”®\n\nBased on input like the preceding, vision as used in this report is mental, cognitive—not reality, or even close to reality, as we know it today. It is influenced, at least in part, by imagination, reflective of actual or desired values, and focused on “what,” not “how.” Finally, a vision is stimulating, energizing, engaging, and inclusive. In contrast, a vision is not, and does not contain, the means to achieve it."

Globalization Theme\n\nEarly in the Summit, and immediately after hearing the globalization keynote presentation by Ralph R. Peterson, CEO and Chairman, CH2M Hill (see Appendix A), six breakout groups focused on globalization. Two groups addressed the professional practice dimension of globalization, two groups addressed the infrastructure dimension, and two groups addressed the environmental dimension. Immediately after the breakout groups completed their work, the globalization theme team used input from the six breakout groups to prepare the following tabular summary, which was immediately presented and discussed at a plenary session. The summary is structured around the following two questions:\n\ne What will be different, with respect to globalization, in the world of 2025? e What could civil engineers be doing in that different world?

These vision statements were used later by the Summit organizers to create a single vision. Presented here are the visions developed by the breakout groups, edited for consistency, clarity, and brevity. Vision 1\n\nWhen civil engineers talk, people listen, because civil engineers are professionals:\n\ne trusted by global society to bring technology and people together to build a better world ,\n\ne recognized as competent decision-makers and advisors for creating and maintaining a superior quality of life, and\n\ne seen as the designers and constructors of the built environment, protectors of the natural environment, shapers of public policy, and leaders in the global quest toward the imagined future. Vision 2 Civil engineers create a sustainable global community by:\n\ne being ethical, compassionate, sensitive, apolitical, diverse, inclu- sive, flexible, respected, and visionary;\n\ne knowing the body of knowledge needed to enter the profession and the role of life-long learning; and\n\ne doing, that is, by leading, collaborating, partnering, communicat- ing, teaming, managing, adapting, persuading, inspiring, develop- ing, and articulating. Vision 3\n\nCivil engineers create, utilize, and share appropriate technology that improves the quality of life, meets the needs of diverse populations and cultures, preserves and enhances the natural and built environments, inspires optimism, and establishes them as the partner of choice and collaborative integrator for sustainable progress. Civil engineers have become sustainability engineers viewed as the Number 1 resource for technical leadership in creating a safer, cleaner, equitable, and sustainable civilization. Civil engineers facilitate appropriate technology transfer that improves the quality of life while being sensitive to and respectful of diverse cultures and social needs. Vision 4 Civil engineers, as a result of their:\n\ne passionate commitment to public health, safety, and welfare, e ethics,\n\ne technical knowledge and skills,\n\ne environmental conscientiousness, and\n\ne innovative and creative outlook\n\nlead, collaborate, and advise to contribute significantly to enhancing the quality of life and creating a better world as the master steward of the natural and built environments. Vision 5\n\nCivil engineers are the people’s engineers who have earned the public’s trust for the care and enhancement of the natural and built environments in which society lives and interacts. Civil engineers are the public’s trusted counselor for delivering infrastructure solutions that improve lives in a sustainable manner. Vision 6\n\nCivil engineers harmonize and shape the natural and built environment to create a better world. APPENDIX L Notes\n\n1. Ron Dubois, Pulitzer Prize-winning biologist suggested the value of vision when he said “In human affairs, the willed future will always prevail over the logical future.” In a humorous fashion, U.S. Hall of Fame baseball player Yogi Berra pointed to the need for vision, or at least direction, when he said “If you don’t know where you are going, you’ll end up somewhere else.”\n\n2.

AUTHOR’S MAIN MESSAGE\n\nThe gradual downsizing of public sectors across the MENA region and the associated aging of public sector workforces provides an opportunity to restructure public sector hiring and compensation practices in a more meritocratic direction. However, as the downsizing continues, women, who are disproportionately dependent on public sector employment will be adversely affected in a context with already low female labor force participation. Therefore, innovative policies are needed to support women’s employment in the private sector to compensate for the loss of opportunities in the public sector. Public employment in the Middle East and North Africa.

Moreover, public sector hiring practices have a significant impact on the efficiency of the overall allocation of human resources in a given economy. The extent of public sector hiring, the qualifications of those hired and the compensation practices of the public sector not only determine how efficiently human capital is deployed in the economy, but also affect the type of human capital that is produced. For instance, by emphasizing credentials rather than skills, public sector hiring practices encourage the over-production of certain credentials that may have little use in the private sector. Public sectors have traditionally been keyemployers inthe Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, even more so than in most other parts of the world. This role has in large part been driven by political agendas, as a means of upholding so-called social bargains with the general populace. However, as these bargains have gradually eroded in importance, a new opportunity presents itselftto remake the public sector in countries across the region. In particular, the aging of public sector workforces presents an opportunity to restructure through early retirement schemes and a re-orientation of hiring practices in a more meritocratic direction. DISCUSSION OF PROS AND CONS MENA region public sectors are large relative to those in comparable countries\n\nThe MENA region has some of the largest public sectors in the world. As shown in Figure 1, the average share of public sector jobs in total employment in the 2000s was 25% in Egypt, 31% in Algeria, and as high as 40% in Jordan [2]. This compares to just 8% in\n\nFigure 1.

These shares are high even compared to China, which has a particularly large share of public sector employment at 29%. In the oil- rich Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the public sector is the main employer of nationals, accounting for 87% of employed nationals in Qatar; 86% in Kuwait, and 72% in Saudi Arabia [3]. Historically, the provision of public sector employment has been a central component of the dominant social contract in the region, which has come to be known as the “authoritarian bargain” [4]. Authoritarian regimes provided public sector jobs and access to subsidized services and commodities in return for their political quiescence [5], [6]. In some countries, like Egypt and Tunisia, these guaranteed and socially protected lifetime jobs went to those who achieved a minimum level of education, in others, like Jordan, they went to members of Bedouin tribes and other groups critical to the political survival of the regime, and yet in others, like the GCC states, they went to all nationals. By resulting in overstaffing and poor incentives for good performance, the expansion of public sector employment for political purposes often came at the expense of its budgetary sustainability and administrative efficiency. It also resulted in a segmented labor market, where total compensation in the public sector was higher than the market clearing level, leading to queuing behavior and high levels of unemployment among first time entrants eligible for public sector jobs [6]. Finally, the large public sector wage bill threatened fiscal stability and budgetary sustainability leading to calls for downsizing and retrenchment. The timing of these calls varied according to a country’s economic performance. In Egypt, for example, public sector hiring began to stall in the 1970s due to such pressures. The public sector share in hiring new entrants is declining\n\nIn addition to the growing fiscal burden of an over-sized public sector and the adoption of structural adjustment policies, evolving trends in demographics and educational attainment made it virtually impossible for MENA governments to maintain their side of the “authoritarian bargain” with respect to public sector hiring. Over the past two decades, the region has witnessed an acute version of what is commonly termed a “youth bulge,” a demographic phenomenon driven by falling early childhood mortality and the slow onset of declining fertility [7]. The youth bulge phenomenon was compounded by an increasing share of the population with upper-secondary education and above, the group that is typically eligible for public sector jobs. Starting from a low human development base in the 1980s, the MENA region has achieved near universal enrollment in primary education, an average enrollment of over 70% in secondary education, and close to 30% in tertiary education for both men and women [8]. This increased educational attainment has led to a rapidly growing pool of candidates for public sector jobs and the inability of public sectors around the region to maintain their high ratios of employment among secondary school leavers. As shown in the illustration on page 1, the share of the public sector among jobs obtained by educated new entrants into the labor force has fallen steadily in many MENA countries. For example, in Egypt and Tunisia this share fell from a high of 75-80% in the mid-1970s to around 25-35% in the 2010s. The decline started somewhat later in Algeria and Jordan and was not as steep in Algeria due to its continued access to oil and gas revenues which\n\nIZA World of Labor | August 2019 | wol.iza.org 3)\n\nRAGUI ASSAAD AND GHADA BARSOUM | Public employment in the Middle East and IZA North Africa World of Labor\n\nfinance its expansive public sector. All four countries appear to have experienced a slight increase in the share of public sector employment among educated new entrants just before or around the onset of the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011. The reduced rates of public sector hiring among new entrants eventually resulted in falling rates of public sector employment overall in most MENA economies. As shown in Figure 2, the decline was most pronounced in Egypt, where the public sector share of employment fell from 35% in the early 2000s to 21% in 2017. While most other countries experienced slower declines, several, such as Algeria, Jordan, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have since increased their public sector share of employment after the onset of the Arab Spring uprisings, thereby confirming the political nature of public sector hiring in the region. Data show a surge in hiring not only in countries that witnessed political unrest, but even more so among their neighbors, who feared the contagion effect of dissent. This is seen by comparing the size of public sector employment in 2011 and 2012, which jumped from 6.1 to 6.3 million workers in Egypt; from 0.9 million to 1.1 million in Algeria, from 696,000 to 725,000 in Tunisia; from 916,000 to 956,000 in Morocco; and from 550,000 to 568,000 in Jordan (ILOStat Data and ONS Algeria). Public sectors in oil-rich countries, which already accounted for large shares of employment among nationals, proceeded to offer their employees generous packages in response to the political tensions in the region. For example, Qatar and the UAE announced pay increases of between 50% and 120% in 2011. Even less affluent countries, like Egypt, Morocco, and Jordan took a similar course of action, albeit at lower levels [9]. Figure 2.

IZA World of Labor\n\nIZA World of Labor | August 2019 | wol.iza.org 4)\n\nRAGUI ASSAAD AND GHADA BARSOUM | Public employment in the Middle East and North Africa\n\nIZA World of Labor\n\nThe reductions in the relative size of the public sector in most MENA countries resulted from a slowdown in hiring of new workers rather than through large-scale dismissals or retrenchment of existing workers. This affected the demographic structure of the public sector, leading to substantial aging of the workforce in some countries. Egypt, which has experienced the most substantial decline, saw the proportion of workers in the public sector above the age of 45 increase from 40% in 2000 to 53% in 2014. Similarly, the share of those aged 45 and older increased from 26% in 2001 to 34% in 2010 in Algeria and from 34% in 2005 to 38% in 2013 in Tunisia. By contrast, in countries where the decline in the public sector share was more modest, the share of those aged 45 and older increased only slightly (e.g. in Jordan, from 14.1% in 2003 to 14.8% in 2014). However, it should also be kept in mind that Jordan, with its volunteer armed forces, includes as public sector employees members of the armed forces, who tend to be younger on average. Other countries, like Egypt, that rely on compulsory enlistment, do not include personnel of armed forces in household labor surveys. Hence, among Jordanian female public sector workers, who are not likely to be in the armed forces, the proportion of those aged 45 and older increased from 10.5% in 2003 to 15.7% in 2014. Public sectors are increasingly feminized\n\nIn addition to their aging demographic makeup, public sector workforces in the MENA region tend to be increasingly feminized. Starting from a low base, women’s increased access to secondary and tertiary education has been a key factor in this development. As shown in Figure 3, the share of women in public sector employment has tended to increase over time in all MENA countries, with the possible exception of lraq. For example, the share of women increased from 25% in 2001 to over 31% in 2017 in Egypt, from 20% in 2001 to 27% in 2016 in Algeria, from 17% in 2005 to 21% in 2014 in Jordan, and from 22% in 2001 to 26% in 2012 in Morocco. In Palestine, meanwhile, the share grew from 19% in 2001 to 25% in 2011, only to fall back to 23% by 2017. These increases were considerably higher than the growth in the share of women in overall employment during the same period, indicating that women have been disproportionately seeking public sector jobs. The feminization of the public sector workforce is driven in part by the closing of the gender gap in education and the subsequent growing share of women with secondary and tertiary education in the region. In fact, women now outnumber men among those pursuing university degrees, with the ratio of female to male tertiary enrollment across the MENA region at 1.08. In some countries, the ratio is far more favorable to women, such as in Qatar (1.76) and Tunisia (1.59) [8]. The increased access among women to tertiary education created a larger pool of potential candidates for public sector jobs, as most public sector hiring in the region is based on achieving certain educational credentials. Additionally, women strongly prefer public sector over private sector employment. This is partly due to the fact that the public sector provides workplaces that are more hospitable to women, including some that are separated by gender in some GCC countries. The public sector also offers favorable working conditions such as relatively short working hours, job security and stability, and social and health benefits, all of which are particularly valued by educated female workers [10]. Although these job characteristics apply to both men and women, within the prevailing culture that gives primacy to women’s domestic roles and responsibilities, these public sector traits are even more strongly preferred among women [11]. In fact, data tracking women’s employment before and after marriage show\n\nIZA World of Labor | August 2019 | wol.iza.org\n\nRAGUI ASSAAD AND GHADA BARSOUM | Public employment in the Middle East and IZA North Africa World of Labor\n\nFigure 3.

It is also well established that while women are paid equally to similarly qualified men in the public sector, they are paid almost half as much in private sector employment [13]. Although public sector workforces have become more feminized, women’s overall employment opportunities have been adversely affected by the contraction of public sector hiring. Female labor force participation rates in the MENA region are the lowest in the world and are rising very slowly, despite the aforementioned rapid gains in women’s education. This disconnect between stagnant participation rates and rising educational attainment has been dubbed the “MENA paradox” [1], [8]. Moreover, a substantial portion of women’s participation takes the form of unemployment, particularly among young educated new entrants who are queuing for public sector jobs. Unlike men, who must often fall back on low-quality jobs in the informal economy, unemployed young women often exit the workforce altogether rather than take jobs in the informal economy. Informal jobs, such as domestic service or work in small retail establishments, are widely perceived as threatening to women’s sexual safety and reputation and incompatible with gender norms that define women’s primary role as that of homemaker [11]. The region as a whole, therefore, is in urgent need of policies to address its high rate of female unemployment and limited labor force participation. Policies should include\n\nIZA World of Labor | August 2019 | wol.iza.org 6)\n\nRAGUI ASSAAD AND GHADA BARSOUM | Public employment in the Middle East and IZA North Africa World of Labor\n\nwomen-focused active labor market programs, reforms in social services such as public transportation and childcare support, and state-supported programs that reward and encourage work, including pay supplements and reduced social insurance contributions. Private sectors are unable to compensate for public sectors’ declining hiring share\n\nThe expansion of public sectors in the region may have come at the expense of crowding out private sector growth, but the subsequent withdrawal of the public sector from the economy has not necessarily resulted in growing and dynamic private sectors. A study from 2013 shows that MENA private sectors have among the world’s highest average firm age, with the majority of firms starting small and staying small. The regulatory environments in most MENA countries often contribute to a high cost of formality, pushing many businesses into informality. Certain markets are also protected or monopolized by the state, allowing only a few privileged insiders to participate. In the World Bank’s ease of business ranking, the UAE is the only MENA country that appears among the top countries (ranked 11 in 2019). Among other region countries, it was followed by Morocco and Bahrain (ranked 60 and 62, respectively). Egypt, the largest country in the region, ranked 120. The general complexity of doing business in the region contributes to increased informality, both at the enterprise and job levels. At the firm level, registration complexity and high cost inhibit formalization, confining small businesses to the realm of informality. Informal employment, either in formal or informal enterprises, leads to loss of access to benefits and social protection. Data on active contributors to old-age pension schemes is a good proxy measure for informality. Active contributors to pension schemes range from 2.8% of the working-age population in Oman to 29.0% in Egypt, and access to contributory schemes correlates strongly to the data on the share of public sector employment in labor markets in the region. In fact, the size of the public sector is clearly a predictor of access to contributory schemes. With small and anemic formal private sectors, the oversized public sector constitutes the dominant component of formal employment in the economy. The remaining employment is mostly in the informal economy and is thus characterized by weak social protection and no social insurance coverage [6]. Private sectors in the region are not compensating for the loss of jobs in the public sector, which intensifies populist demands for more public sector jobs. Supporting the growth of the private sector by improving the business climate and reducing the costs of formality would ultimately ensure a transition of social contracts in the region, from a reliance on public sector hiring as a tool for political favors, to one of shared prosperity based on a dynamic private sector. LIMITATIONS AND GAPS\n\nA key limitation when attempting to propose appropriate reforms in public sector hiring in MENA is the lack of information on public sector hiring and compensation practices, including the number of qualifications of recruits, the selection processes used, and the process by which compensation and benefits are determined.

For countries where no micro-data is available, this article relies on published figures by the International Labor Organization (ILOSTAT), which often lacks the necessary details or is outright missing for many countries. Greater access to micro-data would allow more detailed analyses of the changing demographics of public sector workforces over time. SUMMARY AND POLICY ADVICE\n\nPublic sector hiring is declining in the MENA region as social contracts that have traditionally offered public sector jobs in exchange for the political quiescence of critical constituencies erode. Because incumbent workers were protected as public sectors contracted, considerable aging has occurred within the public sector workforces in many countries. The imminent retirement of large numbers of workers, possibly aided by some early retirement schemes, provides an opportunity for a major restructuring of hiring processes in a more meritocratic direction. This approach would capitalize on the already highly attractive nature of public sector jobs to substantially upgrade the quality of recruits. This is also an opportunity to institute civil service reforms that more directly tie compensation to performance as a way to upgrade the quality of public services. Because women are more dependent on public employment, the decline in public sector hiring affects them disproportionately. There is therefore a need to facilitate greater access for women in the private sector through reforms in social services, such as public transportation and childcare, and other state-supported programs that make it possible for women to continue working in the private sector after marriage.
