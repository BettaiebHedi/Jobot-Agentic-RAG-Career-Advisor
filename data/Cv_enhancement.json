        "Curriculum Vitae\n\nTips and Samples\n\nTHE BASICS\n\nThe curriculum vitae, also known as a CV or vita, is a comprehensive statement of your educational background, teaching, and research experience. It is the standard representation of credentials within academia. The full CV is only used when applying for academic positions in four-year institutions. Do not use a CV when applying to community colleges—use a teacher-focused\n\nrésumé instead. Tailor your CV to the specific positions to which you are applying and place more relevant sections earlier in the document. –\n\nFor a position at a teaching-focused liberal arts college, the CV will strongly emphasize teaching. –\n\nFor a position at a research-intensive university, the CV will accentuate research. Format can vary by field, so also seek disciplinary-specific advice from advisers, professors, and others within your field. There are no length restrictions for CVs. FORMATTING\n\n\n\nYour CV must be well organized and easy to read. Choose an effective format and be consistent. Use bolds, italics, underlines, and capitalization to draw attention. List all relevant items in reverse chronological order in each section. Strategically place the most important information near the top and/or left side of the page. –\n\nIn general, place the name of the position, title, award, or institution on the left side of the page and associated dates on the right. Use a footer with page numbers and your last name, in case pages get separated. DESCRIBE YOUR EXPERIENCES\n\nArticulate what you have done and take advantage of the opportunity to describe\n\nyour research and teaching experiences—do more than simply list them. Avoid the bland phrase “responsibilities included.” This can sound like a dull job\n\ndescription. Instead, use bullets to describe your activities, accomplishments, and successes. 217-333-4610 | GradCareers@illinois.edu | grad.illinois.edu/CareerDevelopment\n\nRev 06/2014\n\n2\n\nSECTIONS TO INCLUDE\n\nThe Basic Sections\n\nHeading: Name, email address, mailing address (only one), and phone number\n\nEducation: List academic degrees, with in progress or most recently earned first.

It’s about marketing."
    ],
    [
        "Remember, your résumé is a marketing document. It “sells” you and your qualifications for a job opportunity. Its purpose is to prompt an employer to invite you to interview. 2. Keywords are critical. Your résumé may be scanned into an applicant database. Use keywords that a recruiter may enter into a search query so that your résumé comes up in search results. 3."
    ],
    [
        "Customize if possible. The document should get across the most important points for your desired job. Select information and language that supports your job objective, highlights your qualifications, and reflects the job of interest as much as possible. 4. Write tightly. Résumés need to be concise. Undergraduates and new graduates rarely need more than one page to tell their story. 5. Make it easy and inviting. Résumés should be logically organized, visually appealing, and “scannable” by the reader in 20-30 seconds. 6."
    ],
    [
        "Spell it out. Avoid acronyms that the reader might not understand. If you use an acronym or abbreviation, use it after the spelled-out version. (Ex. if you write University of Massachusetts Lowell (UMass Lowell), you can refer to UMass Lowell from that point on.)\n\n7. Consistency counts. The text needs to be consistently formatted. Layout, font, style, punctuation, and organization should be the same throughout the document. 8."
    ],
    [
        "Not too personal. Do not include information about your race, age, marital status, or religion, or your Social Security number. Also avoid using first person pronouns such as “I,” “we,” and “my.”\n\n9. Tell the truth. Always be truthful on your résumé; but you can be selective about what you include. 10. No typos! Make sure your résumé is error-free. Using Spell Check on your computer is NOT enough! Have someone read your résumé for content, flow, grammar, and spelling. Try reading it out loud, too."
    ],
    [
        "11. Don’t use templates. Templates seem convenient, but are very difficult to edit and often don’t make the best use of space. Creating your resume on a blank Microsoft Word document allows more control over the look of your resume. 12."

    [
        "Practice talking about it. Be prepared to discuss everything on the résumé in an interview. A practice interview with a career counselor is a great way to rehearse this process.

Skills section can include soft skills, technical, computer, or laboratory skills, and language skills. Highlighting course projects can be a good way to demonstrate specific job related skills that you have gained through hands-on academic experiences. Try to be as specific as possible about the skills you have developed through projects. Work experience should be listed in reverse chronological order. The use of bullet points can make a resume easier to read (it draws the reader’s eyes down the page). Begin each bullet with an action verb in the appropriate tense. When writing descriptors, try to communicate what you accomplished in the position. Quantify experience whenever possible, e.g., Assist in managing and supporting 20+ Aquatics Department team members. Some students may add volunteer and campus involvement sections to their resumes.

It uses your past experiences and accomplishments to position you for future opportunities. From an employer’s perspective, resumes are used to identify qualified candidates to invite to an interview. Resumes do not generate job offers, but well written resumes do facilitate interviews. They are a marketing tool. The resume is important, but just\n\none of several steps that make up a successful job search. Things to know before you get started:\n\n¢ Your resume will be among a stack of resumes that will be viewed for no more than 30 seconds. + Applicant tracking systems scan resumes for keywords that match the company’s job descriptions. Use words in your resume that match the job description. If the keywords/skills are missing, your resume may be rejected. Don’t be vague, you need to do more than simply list functions you had at a previous job. What did you accomplish? What problem did you solve? (see accomplishment worksheet)\n\nDon’t lie or embellish the truth (employers will check your references)\n\n¢ Rules of the English language are forgotten\n\no Avoid first person pronouns “T” “Me” or “We”\n\no Keep sentences short. Sentence fragments are acceptable. ¢ Assemble all personal and factual information before you construct your resume. * Work on your resume one section at a time. ¢ Use a dictionary or thesaurus to avoid repetitive wording. Choose a standard font (Times New Roman, Ariel, Helvetica) Keep the font size between 10-12 pt. (10 pt. is only recommended to keep to one page)\n\nResume should be 1 page- every line is valuable real estate\n\nPrint resume on 24 LB Bond paper (white or cream)\n\nComponents of a good resume:\n\nPersonal Information\n\nYour name, address, city, state, cell phone number and email address should be highly visible, centered at the top of the page. *Note: E-mail address and cell phone voicemail must be\n\nprofessional."

        "Objective (optional)\n\nNot all employers require an objective. An objective identifies which position you are seeking. Place an objective on your resume when you are applying for a specific position. Highlights of Qualifications\n\nThe qualifications section delivers an impact at the top of your resume — it’s your first impression. The qualification statements should match your skills to the target job description. You want the employers to read the summary and say “we have to meet this person.” Information in this section must be customized to fit cach position you apply for. Place most important words first since the scanner may be limited in the number of words it reads. List hard skills not soft skills\n\n(see skills sheet). Experience\n\nUse separate headings for Internship and Work experience List in reverse chronological order, specifying employer name, city and state, job title, and dates of employment. Use action verbs (see sheet) to describe your tasks, hi-lighting your accomplishments and skills (review accomplishment sheet) and relating these to individual job requirements. If you\n\nhave not completed an internship, you may consider adding a section titled “Career Related Experience”. Education List all collegiate experiences (degree received) in reverse chronological order. Include school name, city and state, degree, anticipated graduation date, majors, minors, GPA (optional). You may also list relevant course work, Dean’s List,\n\nand scholarships. Study abroad would also be listed under this section using the same format. Activities\n\nEmployers have indicated that involvement in extracurricular activities demonstrates leadership, time management and organizational skills. The following is a list of activities that can be included in this section: organizations/associations, volunteerism, community involvement, and athletic teams, (if you have held a leadership position, be sure to include this\n\nwith the activity). You may choose to have a leadership section if you have several experiences. References\n\n“Reference available upon request,” can be omitted. It is understood that you will supply references. Create a separate reference page and bring it with you to the interview. Include the reference name, title, organization/company name, business address, phone number, and email of each reference. Include only those\n\npersons who have agreed to serve as a reference for you. List all your personal information at the top of this\n\npage.

Employers often receive hundreds of applications for one open position. Many employers use Applicant\n\nTracking Systems (ATS) to manage all these applications and streamline the hiring process. ATS is a\n\nscanning software that sorts, screens, and scores your resume before a human reader ever sees it. Resumes that cannot be read by ATS or score below a certain threshold may never be seen by a\n\nperson. Tips to get past ATS:\n\nAdd keywords and phrases found in the job description to tailor your resume to the job posting\n\nDo not use a resume template\n\nDo not use graphics, images, colors, symbols, text boxes, columns\n\nDo not put contact information in the document header\n\nCreate/save your resume as a MS Word document (unless a different file type is specifically\n\nrequested)\n\nDo not use a functional resume format\n\n\n\nInclude easy-to-read dates (i.e. June 2022 or 06/2002) so ATS can calculate your years of\n\nexperience\n\nAvoid abbreviations\n\nLeft align all sections\n\n2\n\nGENERAL RESUME GUIDELINES\n\nResume Dos:\n\nDo keep your resume to 1-2 pages (1 page is typical for a recent grad; more experience warrants\n\n2 pages)\n\nDo check your spelling! o Use spellcheck and proofread your entire resume (Spellcheck does NOT proofread words\n\nin ALL CAPS)\n\nDo optimize your resume for Applicant Tracking Systems • Do organize and format your resume, so it is easy for the reader to find the most relevant information. Do give the document a professional and specific name (ex. FirstnameLastname_Resume) • Do keep font sizes 11-12 for text, 12-14 for headings, and 16-22 for your name; use one professional font (Times, Calibri, Arial, Verdana, etc.)\n\nDo keep margins between .5 inch to 1 inch (narrow to normal settings on Microsoft Word); if\n\nyour resume looks short or you do not have a lot of experience, use 1-inch margins\n\nResume Don’ts:\n\nDon’t exaggerate titles or responsibilities; honesty is always the best policy • Don’t use a template created by Microsoft Word or found online Instead, start with a blank Word document o\n\nDon’t include references or “References Upon Request”; provide references in a separate\n\ndocument when asked\n\nDon’t include personal information: hobbies, family, social security number, birthdate, etc. • Don’t use personal pronouns such as “I, me, my, their” • Don’t overuse bold, italics, underlining\n\nOrganizing your Resume There are a few ways to organize a resume. Your format will depend on your experience and goals. Chronological Resume: Organized with the most recent experience listed first and older experiences follow in reverse chronological order. Functional Resume: Organized with your relevant skills and experiences listed first. This format may have headings for skills such as Project Management, Leadership, etc. A work history section is generally included separate from skills. This resume format is generally not recommended as it can be difficult for employers and ATS systems to interpret. Combination Resume: Mixes format of a chronological and functional resume by including optional sections like summary and skills. 3\n\nRESUME SECTIONS\n\nThere are a variety of sections you could include on your resume. The sections you include will depend on your experience and job target. REQUIRED SECTIONS: These sections should be included on all resumes.

We encourage you to take a holistic approach to creating your resume, considering your unique set of experiences in relation to the types of roles to which you aspire. In other words, think of your resume as a marketing tool that demonstrates how a product (you) meets the needs of a potential customer (employer). If you are...

Introductory Resume Worksheet\n\nAdvanced Resume Worksheet\n\nOn Page... 3\n\n4\n\nThis Resume Guide is designed for both the novice resume writer and the more seasoned candidate. Follow the basic principles, adding in advanced components when appropriate. Shifting career directions\n\nCrafting Your Descriptions\n\n5\n\nBasic Principles of Resume Writing\n\n1\n\nYour resume’s job is to get you an interview. 2\n\nThe document should be written with the reader in mind\n\n\n\nLook at job descriptions carefully. If certain keywords, skills, or traits keep popping up, check that they are reflected in your resume in your own words. Consider the context for which you’re using your resume and adjust content, headers and details to match the specific job/internship posting, scholarship application, career fair/ Meetup or other opportunity. Experience comes not only from internships and jobs but from campus activities, class projects and volunteer work as well. There is value – what employers call transferable skills – in all you do as a Princeton student. Readers only know what you tell them. Include concise yet detailed Action-Oriented Accomplishment Statements to pique a reader’s interest. Note differences in style, tone, keywords and content across industries and around the globe. Distinguish yourself from other Princeton students by detailing your individual role and unique impact, especially when several students may have the same experience (e.g., RCA, McGraw Center Tutor). Demonstrate skills through your bullet points in addition to listing them in a “Skills” section. Do not include personal information like age, Social Security number, marital status, religion or parents’ occupations. Think ahead to the interview. Make sure the content you’d talk about is well-represented in your resume. Do you need a CV or resume? In the U.S., a CV is used primarily for admission to – or roles in – academia. It is a type of resume with an in-depth focus on research, presentations, academic awards, and/or publications. 3\n\nYour resume should be easy to scan and digest in 15-30 seconds. Typically resumes should be one page. However, for graduate school, fellowship, and non-corporate applications, it is acceptable to extend to two pages with a significant amount of aligned experience. Use bullet points instead of paragraphs. Avoid pronouns (I, we) and minimize the use of articles (a, an, the). Use CAPS, bold fonts, and line spacing to distinguish between sections. As long as you are aspiring to professional advancement, your resume is a work in progress. • Know that resume writing can be complex and take several\n\n4\n\n\n\nSet the margins between 0.75” and 1” (ideal) and no less than 0.5”. Use consistent font styles and sizes (10-12pt) throughout the document. Save space by leaving off your mailing address. Your phone number and email suffice. List content in reverse chronological order in each section of your resume. tries to master. Save PDF and .txt versions of your resume. Keep prior versions of your resume for reference. Do not fear changing directions. You can reposition any experience by focusing on Transferable Skills. Ask for feedback from a Peer Career Adviser or schedule an appointment with a career adviser in Handshake. Typically resumes should be one page. However, for graduate school, fellowship, and non-corporate applications, it is acceptable to extend to two pages with a significant amount of aligned experience. 2\n\nIntroductory Resume Worksheet\n\nThis worksheet is meant as a guide – not a template – for new resume writers. Do not feel compelled to fill in every blank or section, just focus on those that reflect your experience."

        "4\n\nCRAFTING YOUR DESCRIPTIONS\n\nAdapted from South Dakota State University Office of Career Development; includes content from http://artsbridge.com/how-can-a-theatre-major-prepare-you-for-success/\n\nStudents often lament a perceived lack of experience, struggle to make connections between their experiences and what is required in a job description or worry about how experiences in one realm (e.g., independent research) translate into another (e.g., an industry internship). To allay those fears, use this three-step worksheet to (1) identify your transferable skills or the skills listed in a specific job description (2) note where those skills were learned/developed, and (3) turn these general concepts into Action-Oriented Accomplishment Statements. Step 1: Identify your transferable skills Place a check mark next to each skill you possess. Think about all settings in which you may have used/developed each skill. Then, circle the ones you consider to be your top 10. Communication & Creativity\n\nLeadership\n\nTeamwork\n\nWriting clearly and concisely\n\nListening attentively\n\nExpressing ideas\n\nManaging and supervising groups\n\nDelegating responsibility\n\nPromoting and adapting to change\n\nGenerating and initiating ideas Making decisions with others Respecting others\n\nUsing media to present ideas\n\nPrioritizing tasks\n\nDeveloping rapport\n\nReporting information\n\nIdentifying areas for improvement\n\nSharing credit/cooperation\n\nPublic speaking\n\nFacilitating meetings\n\nInteracting effectively\n\nMaking presentations\n\nDescribing feelings\n\nCoaching/mentoring/counseling\n\nEvaluating progress\n\nCollaborating in diverse or multicultural environment\n\nImprovising\n\nGiving praise and credit\n\nMeeting team expectations\n\nDoing more with less\n\nSetting and accomplishing goals\n\nPerceiving feelings, situations\n\nAppreciating diversity\n\nProviding accurate descriptions\n\nEliciting input and providing feedback\n\nListening to others\n\nProblem-Solving\n\nResearch\n\nGeneral Work\n\nAnticipating potential problems\n\nForecasting/predicting\n\nSetting and meeting deadlines\n\nDefining problems and possible causes\n\nDesigning an experiment\n\nImagining alternatives\n\nAccepting responsibility\n\nEnlisting help\n\nIdentifying and selecting solutions\n\nIdentifying resources\n\nEditing/proofing\n\nCreating innovative approaches\n\nExtracting important information\n\nNegotiating/persuading\n\nInvolving group members in problem-solving\n\nDefining needs\n\nDevelopment strategies\n\nSeeking opportunities for professional growth\n\nDeveloping plans to implement solutions\n\nEstablishing general principles\n\nTeaching/training others Solving problems/mediating\n\nImplementing sound decisions\n\nFormulating conclusions\n\nConceptualizing ideas\n\nObserving and discovering\n\nAnalyzing information\n\nPresenting findings\n\nLearning new tools/techniques\n\nTaking initiative\n\nManaging time and stress\n\nResponding well to feedback\n\nRemaining calm under pressure\n\n5\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm examples of how you used each skill Use this template to list your top 10 skills in the far-left column, then note the place(s) where you demonstrated each skill. Do not sweat the details here, you’ll get to that in Step 3. Although the example below illustrates a skill in use across all three categories, some of your specific skills may have only be used on one or two. Transferable Skill\n\nEmployment & Internship Experiences\n\nCourse Projects & Research\n\nCampus and Community Activities\n\nExample: Public speaking\n\nEnd of summer presentation to department staff\n\nGroup presentation in class last semester\n\nSubmitted proposal for campus-wide event\n\nStep 3: Bring it all together with an accomplishment statement Turn these general concepts into bullet points on your resume. You can ACE this part of resume-writing by starting with an Action Verb to show you did something, providing the Context for that action using quantitative and qualitative terms and then demonstrating the End Result of your actions to show the value of your contributions. Action Verb\n\nContext\n\nEnd Result\n\nExample: Pitched\n\nidea for a “Princeton Popcorn” night to the Undergraduate Student Government\n\nand ultimately created an event which attracted 300+ attendees to a 2-day student-run film festival. 6\n\nACTION-ORIENTED ACCOMPLISHMENT STATEMENTS\n\nShowcasing what you’ve done and why it mattered is the best way to ACE resume writing!

COMMON RESUME TYPES\n\nCHRONOLOGICAL\n\nThe chronological résumé is by far the most commonly used résumé type. It organizes work and educational history in reverse chronological order. Use a Chronological Résumé if... ¢ You are in a more traditional field (e.g., education, counseling, human services, etc.). ¢ You are seeking a job in the same field in which you already have experience. ¢ You are trying to highlight your last place of employment or job title. ¢ You have no significant gaps in employment. FUNCTIONAL\n\nThe functional résumé rearranges employment history into sections that highlight your qualifications, skills and related achievements with little emphasis on employment dates. Use a Functional Résumé if... e You have diverse experiences that don’t add up to a clear cut career path. e You're a career changer. e You want to minimize gaps in employment. ¢ You want to highlight your transferable skills. ¢ You want to de-emphasize your places of employment. THE AVERAGE EMPLOYER SPENDS 15-20 SECONDS\n\nON EACH RESUME, SO ENSURE YOURS IS BRIEF, TARGETED, ERROR-FREE, AND EASY TO SKIM! CURRICULUM VITAE (CV):\n\nIn addition to the traditional sections typically found in a résumé, the CV includes comprehensive sections on teaching and/\n\nor research experience, publications, presentations, fellowship experience, on-campus involvement, languages, association memberships, and other relevant activities. Use a CV if... e You are seeking employment within the academic or research communities. e You are seeking employment abroad. ¢ You are applying for a grant or fellowship\n\ne You don't want to be tied to stricter resumé guidelines regarding the format and length of your document. ¢ You want to highlight a specific focus, research or academic interest. m When in doubt — Use a Chronological Résumé\n\nANATOMY OF THE RESUME\n\nDEVELOPING A WINNING RESUME\n\nRESUME CONTENT\n\nThe length of a résumé is one to two (full) pages. One should only use two pages if you need the additional page to showcase your range of relevant experience. 1. CONTACT INFORMATION\n\ne Name\n\ne Mailing Address\n\ne Telephone Number\n\n¢ E-mail Address\n\n® Online Portfolio, Website, or LinkedIn Profile URL (Do NOT list your Facebook URL)\n\n2. EDUCATION For current students or new graduates, this section should precede experience. e Identify your degree (MA, MEd, PhD, EdD, etc.), Major (Transition Special Education, etc.), name and location of each educational institution attended, and graduation date (projected is fine). ¢ You may include GPA (if 3.0 or better). e Include study abroad, summer institutes, research, or specialized training and experiences in which you have participated. You want to show a prospective employer what makes you unique. 3. EXPERIENCE\n\nEmployers consider experience—paid or unpaid—an integral part of your résumé. Your experience section should highlight the skills you gained and your accomplishments/results on the job. e Within each section of experience, the experience/positions should be listed in reverse chronological order. e Start each phrase with an action verb instead of a subject\n\ne Do not use pronouns (I, me, etc.). e List your responsibilities in order of each item's relative value to the potential employer. ¢ Include your job title, name of the employer, location of the employer and dates you worked. e For each entry, write concise phrases that describe the position, focusing on the skills you developed or gained, and the results achieved. e Focus on transferable skills and cite specific accomplishments on your job using quantitative or qualitative examples. e List volunteer experiences, extracurricular activities and service jobs through which you have learned skills valuable to all employers. ANATOMY OF THE RESUME\n\nDEVELOPING A WINNING RESUME\n\nOTHER POSSIBLE SECTIONS\n\nYour target audience will help you determine which other sections to include on a resume, but you may find\n\nit appropriate to include:\n\n@ Skills (SPSS, Computer Programs, Specialized Counseling or Teaching Techniques, etc.)\n\ne Foreign Language (see ranking guide, page 5) @ Leadership\n\n¢ Volunteer Activities\n\n¢ Honors and Awards\n\n¢ Publications\n\n¢ Presentations\n\ne Professional Affiliations\n\n® Certifications or Licenses\n\n¢ Travel/International Experience\n\n© Qualifications or Summary Section (usually at the top and used by those with significant work experience)\n\nRESUME POINTERS\n\nDO\n\nUse Abbreviations Sparingly Spell out things such as your university, degree, and organizations of which you are a member. Use Clear and Professional Font Styles &\n\nSizes\n\nTimes New Roman, Arial, Garamond or Calibri size 10- 14 work best. Consistent & Effective Formatting To emphasize sections and titles use capitals, spacing, underlining, bolding and white space effectively. Maintain Professionalism Be sure your listed email address and outgoing voicemail are appropriate for employers. Update\n\nYour résumé changes continuously. Every time you have a new experience, add it to your résumé and remove dated items as you gain additional experience. Many job seekers write a new résumé targeted toward each specific job for which they\n\napply. Have Your Résumé Critiqued\n\nWe also encourage you to gain feedback from other professionals in the field, faculty advisors, professional contacts, or a career counselor. DON'T\n\nDon’t Include Personal Information\n\nItems such as marital status, age/date of birth, health and weight/height do not belong on your job search materials. You should not include a photograph. Don’t Include Your Social Security Number...unless specifically asked. Some government positions or other organizations’ application forms may require a Social Security number. Don’t Print “References Available Upon Request”\n\nThis is assumed. Use the space on your résumé to describe your skills. If asked for references, prepare a list of three to five references on a separate sheet of paper. Don't Forget to Edit & Proofread\n\nYour résumé is the employer's first impression of you. Misspelled words, slang and bad grammar will likely eliminate you from an interview list. RESUME BASICS\n\nTAILORING YOUR RESUME\n\nCONNECTING EXPERIENCES, SKILLS, & ACCOMPLISHMENTS WITH JOB ANNOUNCEMENTS\n\nMost people incorrectly believe that you can use the same résumé and cover letter for every new application. This assumption is absolutely false! In order to show an employer that you are truly a candidate that they want to meet, you will want to spend time tailoring your documents to each individual application that you submit. Below is an example of how to effectively connect what you have done with what employers are looking for. POSITION ANNOUNCEMENT: CAREER ADVISOR UNIVERSITY CAREER CENTER\n\nThe Career Center is seeking a full-time Career Advisor to advise students in the School of Communication (SOC) on a wide range of career issues including self- assessment, decision-making, internships, and job development strategies.

        " A CV is a detailed overview of your academic and professional\n\ncredentials and accomplishments.  When might I have to present a CV? When you are applying for:  Graduate school  A post-doc  An faculty job  Grants and fellowships  Any job in the academy (colleges and universities)\n\nA CV is not a résumé\n\nHow are they different? Let’s take a look…\n\nIf you need help with your résumé, please make a visit to the University Career Center. A CV is not a résumé\n\nHow are they different?  Length: résumé- 1 to 2 pages; CV- 2 to 10+\n\n Purpose “The goal of a resume is to construct a professional identity, [whereas] the goal of a CV is quite specifically to construct a scholarly identity. Thus, your CV will need to reflect very specifically your abilities as a teacher, researcher, and publishing scholar within your discipline.”\n\nSource: http://owl.english.purdue.edu\n\nIf you really want to know how to write a CV…\n\nThen look at CV’s in your field…  Faculty pages in your department UTEP Engineering  If not accessible online, ask faculty.  Other online resources include sample CV’s and CV templates. Sample CV's from the University of Pennsylvania How to: CV’s & Cover Letters- Harvard\n\nOrganizing to Craft Your Own CV\n\n Write EVERYTHING down. Okay, well maybe not about the time you won a hot-dog eating contest…  Determine who/what the CV is for…  Really determine who the CV is for…  Look at samples  Craft your CV  Get feedback\n\nStructure of a CV If you were to look at several CV’s, you might notice that they don’t all follow the same format/structure. The structure will partly depend on the strengths you want to showcase, and the strengths you want to showcase will depend on the kind of position you are applying for. Structure of a CV\n\nBut… however you decide to place your CV categories, your CV should be formatted with: 1) Consistency 2) Clarity 3) Sharpness/readability You want to make it easy to read, easy to look over, even a pleasure to look over… How your CV looks and is formatted can make the experience of reviewing your CV a pleasure or a trial. And this can reflect on you as a candidate…\n\nTips for structure & formatting\n\n Important information first  Language that is easy to understand  “Special” CV grammar: gapping & parallelism  Clean font: Times New Roman, 10-12 point  Use indentations, capitalization, boldfacing, italics, and spacing to organize entries and create emphasis.  Be consistent! Example of Gapping\n\nGapping is the use of incomplete sentences in order to present your information as clearly and concisely as possibly. Instead of writing: \"I taught composition for four years, during which time I planned classes and activities, graded papers, and constructed exams. I also met with students regularly for conferences,\" you might write: \"Composition Instructor (2000-2004). Planned course activities. Graded all assignments. Held regular conferences with students.\" By using incomplete sentences here, you cut out unnecessary words and allow your reader to see quickly what you have been doing. Source: http://owl.english.purdue.edu\n\nExamples of Parallelism\n\nParallel structure means using the same pattern of words to show that two or more ideas have the same level of importance. Mary likes hiking, swimming, and bicycling."

RESUMES/COVER LETTERS\n\nRESUMES\n\nA resume is a brief summary of your qualifications, education, and experiences relevant to your job search objective . The purpose of a resume is to obtain an interview . Employers will spend less than 30 seconds reviewing your resume; therefore, the information must be conveyed in a clear, well-organized style . The sections of a resume are listed below . Your Name Email address Phone number\n\nCurrent Address Web page and/or LinkedIn address (if pertinent)\n\nPermanent Address (optional)\n\nObjective This section is optional. The objective can include the specific position you are seeking, skills you wish to use on the job, field or organization type by which you wish to be employed, or a combination of all of the above. Sample Objectives • A position as an editorial\n\nassistant. Education This section should include: • Name of the degree-granting institutions; List most recent first. • Degree received and major • Graduation date or projected graduation date, or dates of attendance if a\n\ndegree was not completed\n\nElectrical engineering internship. To obtain a position in finance. • A program coordinator position in a community organization working with youth. Overseas academic experience\n\nOptional: • Any minors, specialization or focus areas • Courses relevant to the position for which you are applying • Honors and GPA (if they are a strong selling point). Indicate GPA based\n\non a 4.0 scale. Senior research/honors thesis title and brief description • Freshmen and sophomores can include high school\n\nSeeking a position in museum administration requiring strong writing skills and a background in art history. To apply decision and systems analysis to strategic planning in the telecommunications industry. Experience List most recent experience first. You should include: • Title of the position • Name of the organization and location (city and state) • Dates, including month and year • Descriptions of responsibilities beginning with action verbs (avoid phrases such as “duties included”) • Believable, verifiable accomplishments • Paid jobs, internships, volunteer community service, academic/extracurricular projects involving teamwork or\n\nleadership, special academic research or honors projects\n\nYou may choose to divide your experience into two or more sections. Possible section headers might include Research Experience, Teaching Experience, Leadership Experience or Volunteer Experience\n\nAdditional Information This section could include computer skills, languages, volunteer work, sports, and interests. If one of these areas is relevant to the job, however, you may choose to put it in the “Experience” section. You may also choose to use more specific section headers such as: • Skills • Activities • Interests • Honors and Awards\n\nstudentaffairs.stanford.edu/cdc\n\n2 7\n\nR E S U M E S C O V E R L E T T E R S\n\n/\n\nS R E T T E L R E V O C S E M U S E R\n\n/\n\nTIPS FOR CREATING A SUCCESSFUL RESUME Do’s\n\nDo design your descriptions to focus on your accomplishments, using action verbs to clearly indicate the skills you’ve used . See Sample Action Verb list on the next page . Do try quantifying results in your descriptions, such as “Created marketing campaign that increased club membership by 25% .”\n\nDo keep your resume brief enough to fit on one page (or two pages if your experience is extensive) . Do print your resume on good quality bond paper, either white or conservative tones . If printed on plain computer paper, copy onto good quality bond paper . Do accompany your resume with a cover letter in most cases . • Do have others look over your resume for content and grammar . Career Counselors are available at the career center to critique your resume . Don’ts\n\nDon’t make your margins and font size too small: margins no smaller than one inch and font size no smaller than 10 point . Don’t include personal pronouns (e .g . I, me, we) . • Don’t include personal information, physical characteristics, or photographs on your resume . However, individuals from other countries may include these on their resumes . Don’t include the last line: “References available upon request” (see Sample Reference List on page 45) . Other Tips\n\nIt is more appropriate for freshmen and sophomores to include high school experiences . However, important high school experiences that have some relevance to your job objective may be appropriate for upper classmen . For International Students it is sometimes a disadvantage to include your non-immigrant visa status or permanent address (if outside the U .S .) on your resume . Usually your visa status should be discussed later during the interview . If you have obtained permanent residency or U .S . citizenship, it might be to your advantage to list the information on your resume . RESUME FORMATS\n\nThere is no single way to format your resume . The format you choose should present your strengths clearly . See sample formats and layouts on pages 30 - 43 . Chronological Format\n\nThis format is most familiar to employers and most commonly\n\n2 8\n\nStanford Career Center\n\nthe experience section . This format is simple, straightforward, and especially useful for anyone with a history of directly relevant experience . Functional/Skills Format\n\nThis format focuses on areas of skill and can be effective in conveying your strengths to an employer, although many employers are not as familiar with this format as with the chronological or combination format . This style of resume draws attention to accomplishments and highlights your skills by function rather than your work experience and is more commonly used by people with very little formal work experience or are returning to the workplace after being away or otherwise involved . Combination Format\n\nThis format is appropriate when you have relevant work experience for each of several skill areas and combines both the chronological and functional formats . This style allows you to group your experiences or key selling points together by functional areas (such as Research Experience and Teaching Experience), and then list those experiences in reverse chronological order within each section . It is also a familiar format to employers . SUBMITTING RESUMES VIA EMAIL\n\nSend your resume as an attached file and paste the text into the\n\nbody of the email . Having your resume in the body of the email as well as an attachment gives the employer the opportunity to see your resume in the event they cannot open your attachment or do not take the time . Use a simple format for the resume you put in the body of the email: left justified, no bold, no italics, no underlines, no tabs . See Sample Electronic Resume on page 44 . Don’t forget to include a cover letter in the body of the email too . If you have your resume in a PDF file, you can also attach that with your email . The PDF version will allow the employer the opportunity to see your resume in an attractive format, utilizing bold and underlines . When emailing resume files, name them so the employer can easily identify them as your resume . Last name, followed by first name and the word “resume” is most helpful .

Bear in mind that letters you write not only convey your interest and qualifications, but also give the employer an opportunity to observe your attentiveness to detail, spelling, grammar, and the overall quality of your written communication . Flaws in your letters will often be interpreted as flaws in your qualifications. Address City, ST Zip Code Date\n\nName Title Company/Organization Name Address City, ST Zip Code\n\nDear Mr./Ms. Last Name:\n\nResumes are only as good as the letter accompanying them. So make sure that you spend some time on your letter and direct it to the appropriate person. What you write and how you write it tells potential employers a great deal about your professionalism, competence, and personality. Opening Paragraph: What is your intent in writing this letter? What position are you applying for and how did you learn about it? Briefly introduce yourself, your major, and the degree anticipated. If you are aware of a specific opening, refer to it. If you are not aware of a specific position, state your area of interest. This paragraph can also be used to refer to the individual who recommended that you contact the organization, or other factors that prompted you to write. If possible, convey why you are interested in the organization and anything you know about their product or service. In a job search aimed at busi- ness and professional circles, proper procedures and commu- nication etiquette are important. A cover letter should entice an employer to want to take action on your resume. It should persuade the employer to invite you for a job interview. Second Paragraph: What are your qualifications? Why do you want to work for this organization? What would you enjoy doing for them? Sell yourself and be brief. Whet the employer’s appetite so that he/she will want to read your resume and schedule an interview. Describe highlights from your background that would be of greatest interest to the organization. Focus on skills, activities, accomplishments, and past experience you can contribute to the organization and its work. If possible, demonstrate that you know something about the organization and industry/field. Use action verbs that describe relevant skills and expertise you can contribute. Mention specific knowledge you may have such as computer applications, foreign languages, lab techniques, writing and editing capabilities. You are attempting to create a match or “notion of fit” between the employer’s hiring needs and your interests, experience, and skills. Third Paragraph: What is your plan of action? Do you want to follow up with a phone call or do you want them to contact you? Close your letter by stating that you would like to discuss employment opportunities or other information with the individual and that you will call to follow up on your letter. This demonstrates your initiative and follow-through and will help you maintain some control of your efforts. Other points that can be made in the last paragraph: • Express your willingness to provide additional information • State a specific time when you will follow up by phone or email • Let them know if and when you are going to visit their area • Thank the person receiving your letter for their time and interest\n\nMost importantly, remember to address the cover letter to a person. If you do not have a name, call the department or human resources to find out to whom your letter should be addressed. As a last resort, address your letter to the personnel manager, hiring manager, or recruiting representative. Sincerely, Your First Name and Last Name\n\nStanford Career Center\n\nTIPS FOR CREATING AN EFFECTIVE COVER LETTER\n\nCollect your thoughts . Your ideas may not come out logically or sequentially, but write them down . Don’t judge and evaluate, simply collect them . Spend time on your letter . As the adage goes, “With part-time effort, you get part-time results .”\n\nWrite a draft, let it cool off overnight, and then rewrite if necessary . Use a strong close, e .g ., “After you have had an opportunity to review this letter, I will call you . . .” Avoid weak endings such as “I look forward to your reply” or “Please call me at your earliest convenience .”\n\nLimit your letter to one page; a letter is an opportunity to sell, so say something about you, while also focusing on the needs of the employer . Write the way you talk . It should be well-worded, concise, and controlled in the use of the pronoun “I” . While a general cover letter can be used, best results come from personalizing each letter to fit the specific circumstances, position, or organization . Ask for opinions, advice, and feedback from friends, a counselor, or someone in the profession ."

        "Check spelling and grammar . Avoid cluttered desktop publishing . Business letters should look conservative . If you want to be creative, do so in your choice of words . If should be aesthetically appealing with careful attention to spacing and format . Use letter-quality printer paper or high-quality bond paper . Stick with white, ivory, or off-white . Remember to sign it personally and include your telephone number and email address . Don’t use someone else’s letter . If you are using the same letter for several companies, remember to change the name in the body of your letter . Devise a system to keep track of the follow-up steps you will take and the responses you receive . Most students have found that binders or file folders for organizing the job search and its correspondence are essential . Follow up, follow up . People will call you, but you’ll improve your odds dramatically if you follow up your letters with a phone call . Don’t mark letters “personal and confidential” unless there is a solid reason why a secretary or an administrative assistant can’t open them . If your letter is persuasive enough, it will get through . COVER LETTERS ONLINE\n\nMore and more job seekers are asked to send their resumes and cover letters online . These letters are about half the length of a regular cover letter . It is important to mention in your letter how you found out about the position, what you are looking for, and what you have to offer . You might also mention a few key words the organization might want to hear . Most importantly, be succinct . Most experts recommend that you compose your cover letter off-line first before importing it into an outgoing email message .

Box 000033 Stanford, CA 94000\n\nOctober 19, 20XX\n\nMs. Marian Armstone Human Resources Manager LEK Consulting 9999 Oak Street Palo Alto, CA 9003\n\nDear Ms. Armstone:\n\nThis letter and the attached resume serve as my application for the Associate position at LEK Consulting. After speaking with Jo Kimmer at Stanford’s Career Fair on October 9, I believe my skills, academic training, and work experience are a good fit for this position. I will complete a Master of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering in June 20XX. I have developed strong analytical and quantitative skills through coursework in technical, computer science, and economics courses. In addition, my hands-on experience in various internships and student leadership positions supports my qualifications as an Associate. As an intern at General Motors this past summer, I developed analytical skills by taking measurements on a development vehicle identifying design problems, offering solutions for improvement, and making recommendations in a written report. I was awarded a General Motors scholarship for my exceptional contributions as a member of the S-10 Crew Cab launch team. At Stanford, I demonstrated leadership ability by serving as the elected president for a service organization with over one hundred active members. In this effort, I honed my ability to make good decisions, plan and organize my time, work well on a team, and have developed sound interpersonal, oral, and written communications skills. Finally, I bring an entrepreneurial spirit and creativity to this position, as evidenced by my experience designing, patenting, and marketing my own product. I would enjoy speaking with you further to discuss, in detail, how I am a match for the Associate position. I will follow up in two weeks to see if there is additional information you would like me to provide or answer questions you may have (another option: I am eager to apply my energy, experience, and enthusiasm to the work of LEK and look forward to hearing from you soon.).

I have experience in fashion journalism through my work with the online magazine One Line to You and have a background in event planning through my work as a Marketing Intern this past summer. Currently, I am a junior at Stanford University studying Communication and International Relations and I plan to pursue a career in fashion upon graduation. Jonson would be a great springboard in achieving that goal. My passion for fashion and art comes from my grandmother who was a fabric designer in New York during the 1940s and 50s. From her, I learned a great deal about color and design. Since the age of 10, I have been consumed by the industry and have studied Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar and Elle magazines. In addition, I analyze and examine the work of designers and follow fashion critics like Suzy Menkes. After beginning to write for the online magazine, One Line to You, I had the opportunity to parlay my depth of knowledge into written pieces about various aspects of the fashion world. My expression through this medium also allowed me to further my education of the industry. I believe the marketing internship at the San Francisco Symphony best prepared me for the responsibilities of an intern at Jonson. In this position I was trusted with a great deal of responsibility. I wrote newsletters, researched artists to compile performance programs, helped with event planning, ran errands, composed press releases and edited and proof-read written material. Through these tasks I learned the importance of being thorough while working in a fast-paced environment. My attention to detail and organization allowed me to thrive in this context and they will do the same at Jonson. After reviewing Jonson’s spring ready-to-wear collection, I feel it would be amazing to work toward the new creative director Heather London’s vision. It must be a very exciting time for the Jonson label. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future and am available for an interview at your convenience. Please contact me with any questions you may have. Thank you for your time and consideration.

I have also taken the liberty of attaching a sample of my writing. I was encouraged to contact you after speaking with my high school journalism teacher, Mr. Bill Jenkins, who has ties with Ms. Sally Smith of your organization. As I mentioned in our discussion, I am currently a student at Stanford University and am very interested in journalism, advertising, and graphic design. I am seeking an opportunity to develop and utilize my skills and qualifications in a paid summer internship, doing whatever work possible. Growing up in Corpus Christi, the Caller-Times has always been part of my life. Now that I am older I have come to respect it as a professional service vital to our community, and am now eager to enlist and gain insight into the career I dream of holding. My passion for journalism has only grown with time. As a Managing Editor of Hoofbeat, my high school’s national award-winning newspaper, I collaborated with fellow editors and managed a staff of nearly 30 younger writers as part of the overall process of overseeing production of the newspaper from conception to publication. As my resume indicates, I have demonstrated strong leadership and undergone extensive training through active participation in academic and professional organizations. In my effort to fully develop these important skills, I will continue to serve as a Layout Designer for The Stanford Scientific, the only full-color publication on campus for the duration of this academic year. I hope to gain the position of Head of Production in the years ahead. In addition to my experience in journalism, my instruction includes coursework in statistics, psychology, and persuasive writing, and experience fielding phone calls and collecting data. My education has honed the writing, planning, organization, and presentation skills that I believe are essential to working in communications. I am excited about the many aspects of the journalism world and welcome the prospect of discussing opportunities to explore them in your company. I will follow up in a week to answer questions you may have or provide additional information. In the meantime, should you have questions, I can be reached at 650-555-5555 or sjohnson@stanford.edu.

In addition, working throughout my Stanford career to finance a substantial portion of my education has strengthened my time management skills and determination to pursue and achieve my goals. These skills, together with my passion for photography, fascination with the consumer market, and personal interest in the creative side of advertising lead to my strong interest in this field.
