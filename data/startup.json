        "Overview\n\n1. The Australian Government has established Startup Year to support students’ participation in startup courses at Australian higher education providers, to encourage innovation and support Australia’s startup community, including social innovation and community-based entrepreneurship. 2. The October 2022-23 Budget provides $15.4 million over four years from 2022-23 to\n\nestablish Startup Year. It establishes a new income contingent loan program to support student participation in Startup Year courses (also known as accelerator program courses) providing up to 2,000 loans a year to recent graduates, postgraduate and final year undergraduate students through the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP). This loan will be known as STARTUP-HELP. It also extends eligibility for student payments (such as Youth Allowance, Austudy and ABSTUDY) to students who participate in a Startup Year course, access a STARTUP-HELP loan, and meet other eligibility requirements. 3. Higher education accelerators enhance and develop student skills, capabilities, and\n\nnetworks, and foster greater levels of entrepreneurialism and talent within the Australian innovation ecosystem. STARTUP provide future pathways for graduates. HELP will fund the educational experience of students and\n\n4. The Government wants to see more students across a wide range of backgrounds become founders of startup companies and innovation leaders in the workforce. Startup Year will prioritise support for First Nations Australians, people with disability, and women, along with startups solving regional and rural issues, ensuring there is increased engagement from people from these important groups. ‑\n\nStartups and the accelerator ecosystem\n\n5. Startups have an important role in job creation, commercialising ideas, solving social and community-based issues, and strengthening links between universities and the broader community. On average across OECD countries, young firms account for approximately 20 per cent of employment and create almost half of all new jobs.1 In Australia, startups have a high impact on the creation of new jobs. Research suggests that job creation is highly concentrated. In 2020, an increase of over 3,000 employees could be attributed to Australia’s eight most successful startups.2 The Tech Council of Australia estimates new technology startups can contribute 30,000 new jobs and $7 billion in value by 2030.3 Supporting startup creation and the entrepreneurial skillset will play a role in growing productivity and incomes and build a workforce with the skills and capabilities to adapt and thrive in the future labour market. 1 OECD (2022), DynEmp: Measuring Job Creation by Start-ups and Young Firms, www.oecd.org/industry/dynemp.htm. 2 G20 Entrepreneurship Roundtable (2021), Entrepreneurship in Australia: Promotion of Entrepreneurship and Startups in the Digital Area. 3 Tech Council of Australia (2021), Roadmap to Deliver One Million Tech Jobs, How to Deliver One Million Tech Jobs by 2025 – Tech Council of Australia. Startup Year Provider Handbook | 4\n\n6. Beyond job creation, startups have a role in driving research translation and\n\ncommercialisation across a range of industries, particularly in the deep tech industry.4 This has been supported by the emergence of university-based accelerator programs, bringing together industry, academic expertise, and resources to build and accelerate startup ideas. According to Universities Australia, there are more than 100 hubs in Australian universities.5 These accelerator programs offer immersive, wraparound services to support students and first-time entrepreneurs with their startup ideas. 7."

Workshops, resources, and education within an accelerator program often focus on business skills and media and public relations. The University of Wollongong, through its iAccelerate program offers a robust education component through the pre-acceleration program – Activate. Activate is an educational program focusing on themes such as lean methodology, marketing and branding, basic business, pitches and turning ideas to Minimal Viable Products.6 An educational component to accelerator programs helps to build important skills learners need to build their startups. Mentoring and networks\n\n9. Research from Startup Muster (2018), an Australian survey on the startup ecosystem, found that 58.5 per cent of startup founders have accessed mentorship since founding their startup. Meaningful mentorship and access to a network of innovators and entrepreneurs is a key feature of an accelerator program (see RMIT University’s LaunchHUB,7 GRIST: The Mill House Social Enterprise Accelerator Program8 and the BETA Pre-Accelerator Program9.) Wide exposure to business networks is important for founders and researchers looking to test their ideas, overcome challenges, find capital, build a team, create or reach new markets and grow their business. 4 Startup Muster (2018), Startup Muster Annual Report, 19, https://startupmuster.com/reports/Startup- Muster-2018-Report.pdf?key=d3fcf8771af17253b761c908b5f7abe8b407c5c671bbafb74cfd51c09414efec. 5 Universities Australia (2022), University Startup Hubs, www.universitiesaustralia.edu.au/our- universities/university-startup-hubs/. 6 iAccelerate (2022), Accelerate Your Idea.

Startup Year Provider Handbook | 5\n\nAccess to facilities, equipment, and co-working spaces\n\n10. Universities are developing state of the art facilities, co-working spaces, and innovation precincts, available to students to access as part of an accelerator program. Through the Melbourne Accelerator Program, students have access to the University of Melbourne’s innovation hub that brings together research, industry, government, higher-degree students and other elite thinkers in a purpose-built precinct to foster collaboration and amplify innovation.10 The University of Technology Sydney's UTS Startups program is a notable example of the creation of new startups at scale, with visits to 100 schools each year around NSW, and workshops for 5,000 UTS students each year. This program then provides free space and support to 490 active student-launched startups, in return for these startups participating in peer mentorship, providing internships and in-subject projects, and helping to inspire the next generation of founders.11 These shared spaces and access to world-class facilities helps to strengthen concepts and build prototypes to get startups market ready. Pilot\n\n11. Startup Year is commencing with a targeted pilot to test aspects of program design, gauge student demand, assess providers’ capacity to deliver the program, and give providers (especially those in regional Australia and those with newer innovation and accelerator ecosystems) time to develop and accredit their accelerator courses prior to the full rollout of the initiative. 12. Startup Year pilot courses commence in 2024. 13. The Department of Education (the Department) has appointed a Startup Year Working Group, comprised of representatives from the university, business, and government sectors, to monitor the implementation and operation of Startup Year during the pilot. The Working Group’s role includes providing advice to the Department on the Startup Year program settings and any other matters affecting program outcomes and objectives. 14. The Department will also work closely with participating providers to understand\n\nimplementation challenges, the student experience, and areas for future improvement. The Department may call on participating providers to provide information to the Startup Year Working Group, including details of participant diversity, course attrition/completion rates, participant destination and outcomes information, and course evaluations. 15. Participating providers will be consulted on any changes to the policy in advance of the full\n\nrollout. Legislation\n\n16. Part 3-7 of the Higher Education Support Act 2003 (HESA) provides the legislative basis for\n\nSTARTUP-HELP assistance. 10 The University of Melbourne (2022), Australia’s Leading Startup Accelerator, www.themap.co. 11 UTS (2022), Techcelerator, www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-engineering-and-information- technology/research-faculty-engineering-and-it/funding/techcelerator. Startup Year Provider Handbook | 6\n\n17. The Higher Education Support (STARTUP-HELP) Guidelines 2023 (STARTUP-HELP Guidelines) provide further requirements on providers in relation to the operation of STARTUP-HELP. 18. The Higher Education Support (Administration) Guidelines 2022 (Administration Guidelines)\n\nand the Higher Education Provider Guidelines 2023 (HEP Guidelines) also impose requirements on providers in relation to the provision of accelerator program courses and STARTUP-HELP assistance. 19. This Handbook is not a legal document and does not create legal obligations. It should be\n\nread in conjunction with Part 3-7 of HESA, the STARTUP-HELP Guidelines, the Administration Guidelines and the HEP Guidelines, which place obligations on providers in relation to accelerator program courses and the provision of STARTUP-HELP assistance. Terminology\n\n20. HESA refers to courses under the Startup Year program as “accelerator program courses.”\n\n21. For the purposes of this handbook, any reference to “startup year courses” is interchangeable with “accelerator program course” as defined in HESA. Designing Startup Year courses\n\nEligible providers\n\n22. Only higher education providers that are registered by the Tertiary Education Quality and\n\nStandards Agency as Australian Universities or University Colleges are eligible to bid for and receive allocations of STARTUP-HELP places. Eligible Startup Year courses\n\n23. HESA defines an “accelerator program course” as:\n\nA structured and integrated program of education and mentoring designed to develop a person’s skills, capabilities, and connections for startup businesses. 24."

Not exceed the prescribed course costs for a Startup Year course (see below). c. Lead to the award of a qualification accredited by the higher education provider. d. Include assessment of student learning and performance. e. Have a course description that includes learning outcomes. f.

        "Not be delivered to a student who is in receipt of FEE-HELP assistance for the course. 25. Providers have discretion in how they structure their accelerator program course and the\n\nqualification that it confers on students. 26. Providers must determine the EFTSL value of a Startup Year course based on the amount of\n\ntime taken to complete the course on a full-time basis. Accreditation\n\n27. Successful completion of Startup Year courses must result in the award of a qualification. This qualification should reflect the skills and knowledge the student has obtained over the duration of the course. This credentialling outcome should be an asset to participants as they move into the employment market. 28. Providers are required to self-accredit their Startup Year course using their standard\n\naccreditation procedures as far as practical. 29. Courses do not need to meet a specific level within the Australian Qualifications Framework\n\n(AQF) and can be a non-AQF qualification. Partnerships\n\n30. Providers should build and leverage relationships with industry, non-government\n\norganisations and the broader startup ecosystem to support the delivery of Startup Year courses. These relationships will be essential to ensuring the skills delivered in the courses meet the sectors’ requirements and that participants have access to networks, mentors, and expertise. Course costs\n\n31. HESA sets the maximum course fee for Startup Year courses. Startup Year Provider Handbook | 8\n\n32. In 2024, a Startup Year course fee must not exceed $12,720 for a course with an EFTSL value of one. This amount is linked to the legislated maximum student contribution amount specified for a place for a non-grandfathered student in a unit of study in Medicine, Dentistry or Veterinary Science. Startup Year courses do not attract an additional Commonwealth contribution. 33. As required by HESA, providers must charge all students in a Startup Year course the same course fee, whether or not the student is receiving STARTUP-HELP assistance in relation to the course. 34. For a course that has an EFTSL value of less than one EFTSL, the maximum course fee will be calculated using the same percentage as the EFTSL value. That is, if an accelerator program course has an EFTSL of 0.5, the maximum course fee will be 50% of $12,720 (i.e. $6,360)."

        "35. Different service offerings and target cohorts will likely result in variable course costs\n\nbetween providers. Census date\n\n36. Startup Year courses must have a census date no earlier than 20 per cent of the way through the program from commencement to completion date. There is only one census date for a single Startup Year course. 37. If a student withdraws from the Startup Year course after the census date, they are still\n\nrequired to pay the course fees. They will still have a STARTUP-HELP debt to repay and will lose any upfront payment made. 38. A student may apply to the provider for course fees to be repaid and/or for their STARTUP- HELP debt to be remitted, if the student’s reason for not withdrawing by the census date is due to special circumstances. The student will need to provide evidence to prove that: a. the special circumstances were beyond their control\n\nb. the full impact occurred on or after the census date of the course, and\n\nc. it was impracticable for them to complete the course."

Details of requirements relating to withdrawal from Startup Year courses are outlined in the HEP Guidelines and further information about special circumstances (and when certain elements of the special circumstances test are satisfied) are outlined in the Administration Guidelines. Course duration\n\n40. There is no expectation that all Startup Year courses will be a full year in duration. Startup\n\nYear courses should be structured to have a duration that is no shorter than a semester and no longer than an academic year. Startup Year Provider Handbook | 9\n\nRegistration and application for STARTUP-HELP places\n\n41. The Department invites providers to apply to register their Startup Year courses and bid for an allocation of STARTUP-HELP places. These processes will happen concurrently under the one application process. Pilot\n\n42. Providers will bid for an allocation in 2024. 43. No more than 1,000 STARTUP-HELP places will be allocated in 2024. 44. Places will be allocated through a merit-based process. There is no guarantee that every EOI will be allocated places. Allocation to regional universities\n\n45. As far as reasonably practicable, at least 25 per cent of all students selected for receipt of\n\nSTARTUP-HELP assistance must be enrolled at a regional university. 46. As such, as far as reasonably practicable, at least 25 per cent of STARTUP-HELP places will be allocated to regional universities. HESA provides a list of regional universities at subsection 128B-40(2), and a regional university may also include a university, or a particular campus of a university, which is specified in the STARTUP-HELP Guidelines and is located in a Remoteness Area categorised under the ABS Remoteness Structure (as defined in HESA) as Inner Regional Australia, Outer Regional Australia, Remote Australia or Very Remote Australia.

The Department will allocate STARTUP-HELP places to successful universities annually for\n\nthe first two/three years of the program. Selecting students for STARTUP-HELP\n\nSelecting students for Startup Year courses and STARTUP-HELP\n\n56. The provider must maintain a STARTUP-HELP policy, and select students for STARTUP-HELP\n\nin accordance with that policy. This policy must be publicly available. 57. The provider must use open, fair, and transparent procedures for making decisions about\n\nthe selection of students for STARTUP-HELP assistance. 58. The provider’s STARTUP-HELP policy must facilitate the participation of groups that are\n\nunderrepresented in the startup ecosystem. 59. A provider is not prevented from taking into account educational disadvantages a student has experienced when selecting students for a Startup Year course and STARTUP-HELP assistance. 60. If enrolling full-fee paying students in their Startup Year course, providers will need to ensure they are meeting the relevant legislative requirements (for example, the requirements found in the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011, the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 and the Higher Education Support Act 2003). Enrolling in a Startup Year course (‘accelerator program course’) would also need to be consistent with an international student’s visa status and requirements. 61. Providers can accept and enrol students into Startup Year courses from other institutions. 62. There is no requirement for students to be pursuing a specific startup venture for entry into\n\nStartup Year courses. This remains at the discretion of the provider. Startup Year Provider Handbook | 13\n\nStudent eligibility\n\n63. Student eligibility for STARTUP-HELP will operate in a similar manner to existing HELP types, with additional requirements.12\n\n64.

If a student is enrolled in two or more Startup Year courses at the same time, the student is\n\nentitled to STARTUP-HELP assistance for only one course. Determining STARTUP-HELP eligibility\n\n66. A provider must not select a student for STARTUP-HELP unless the provider is satisfied the\n\nstudent meets all of the eligibility criteria. 67. Providers can access information using the Tertiary Collection of Student Information (TCSI) on how many STARTUP-HELP loans have been reported to the Department for a student.

A provider cannot select a greater number of students for STARTUP-HELP assistance than the number advised by the Department, even if the provider has a sufficient amount of funding to do so. 72. Providers may enrol students into their course who have not been selected for\n\nSTARTUP-HELP assistance. These students will not be able to defer their course costs. They must pay upfront the full fee costs of participation. A provider must require any domestic or international student enrolling in a Startup Year course to pay the same fee for the course as those in receipt of STARTUP-HELP assistance. 73. The Department will conduct a reconciliation of STARTUP-HELP funds/places allocated in the\n\nprevious year, and unused STARTUP-HELP funds will be recovered. Information about loans\n\n74. Like other types of HELP, students eligible for STARTUP-HELP assistance will incur a debt to the Commonwealth of the amount of assistance on a pre-determined census date. A student’s STARTUP-HELP loan will be included in their accumulated HELP debt. Students repay their accumulated HELP debt through the taxation system once their repayment income is above the minimum repayment threshold for compulsory repayments. 75. STARTUP-HELP is not included in the combined HELP loan limit, which caps what students\n\ncan borrow from the Australian Government. 76. Students undertaking Startup Year courses can be charged a student services and amenities\n\nfee (SSAF) and are therefore entitled to receive SA-HELP assistance. 77. Students can find information about STARTUP-HELP on the Study Assist page at\n\nwww.studyassist.gov.au. Students will be able to view information about their personal STARTUP-HELP loans at www.myHELPbalance.gov.au. 78. Students must read the STARTUP-HELP information booklet before applying for STARTUP- HELP assistance.

        "This information must be prominent, easily accessible, and published before the earliest\n\nenrolment date and remain published until the end of the course at a minimum. 81. The provider’s STARTUP-HELP policy must also be publicly available. 82. Details of publication requirements are outlined in HESA and the HEP Guidelines. Course audit requirements\n\nStartup Year course audit requirements\n\n83. If 20 per cent or more of students in a Startup Year course have made a complaint about the\n\ncourse within 12 months of the end date of the course, the provider must conduct an internal audit, or arrange for an audit to be conducted, of the course’s compliance with the requirements for accelerator program courses included in the STARTUP-HELP Guidelines. 84. Details of audit requirements, including the circumstances in which they must be conducted or arranged and when and how they must be undertaken, are outlined in the STARTUP-HELP Guidelines. 85. If an audit finds any material non-compliance with Startup Year course requirements in the STARTUP-HELP Guidelines, the amount of STARTUP-HELP assistance that a student has received will be reversed and the provider must repay the Commonwealth and/or the student any amounts paid to the provider for the course. 86. Details of requirements for Startup Year course grievance procedures are outlined in the HEP Guidelines. Startup Year Provider Handbook | 16\n\nStudent support payments\n\n87. Students entitled to STARTUP-HELP assistance may qualify for relevant student support\n\npayments, including Youth Allowance, Austudy and Pensioner Education Supplement as well as ABSTUDY (should they meet other eligibility requirements) while undertaking a Startup Year course. 88. For other courses of study at a higher education provider, such as an undergraduate degree, a student’s entitlement to student support payments is not contingent on their HELP loan status. For Startup Year courses, entitlement to a STARTUP-HELP loan is a key eligibility requirement. Evidence requirements\n\n89. Students will need evidence of their entitlement to a STARTUP-HELP loan for Services\n\nAustralia to process a claim for student support payments. Ideally this would occur prior to course commencement so the student has financial support from the earliest possible time. 90. Once a student’s loan status is confirmed in the TCSI system (Unit enrolment packet: E384, E381, E529, E558), Services Australia will have access to that information and be able to validate a student’s STARTUP-HELP loan status. Providers are encouraged to report STARTUP-HELP loan information as soon as practicable. Despite this, the Department is aware that there is often a delay between when an enrolment is reported and when the loan details are known and reported. 91. To ensure students are not unfairly disadvantaged by delays in reporting, providers must\n\nalso provide students with written advice that they have been offered a STARTUP-HELP loan. This advice can be incorporated into the letter of offer to the Startup Year course. 92. Written advice must be provided on a university letterhead and signed by an academic\n\nregistrar or equivalent. Part-time students\n\n93. A student cannot combine part-time participation in a Startup Year course with part-time\n\nparticipation in an undergraduate/postgraduate course to meet the participation requirements for student support payments. This is consistent with the current rules for participation in multiple undergraduate degrees on a part-time basis. 94. Given this, providers should give due consideration to how they structure their course\n\nofferings. The following are examples of where an undergraduate student would be eligible for student support payments:\n\na. The student is undertaking at least 75% of a normal full-time study-load in at least\n\none of the Startup Year course or the degree (75% of the normal amount of full-time study is considered a full-time study-load for income support purposes);\n\nb. The Startup Year course is offered as Honours study following an initial degree; or\n\nStartup Year Provider Handbook | 17\n\nc. The Startup Year course is offered as part of a combined course (this course must\n\nhave a unique course code and be included in the university handbook). 95.

Providers must not bid for STARTUP-HELP places if they cannot commit to making the\n\nrequisite ICT upgrades or having other arrangements in place in time to meet their reporting obligations. 100. Providers with queries about TCSI reporting and the TCSI system can contact\n\nTCSIsupport@education.gov.au. Electronic Commonwealth Assistance Forms (eCAF)\n\n101. The Department has developed a new eCAF for STARTUP-HELP assistance. 102. If a provider does not have access to the Government eCAF system they can request access by emailing HEenquiries@education.gov.au, and further information will be provided on how to use the eCAF system. Once access is granted a provider can choose to link their student management system via API or manual upload of student data. Providers using a non-Government eCAF will still require access to the Government eCAF system to build their STARTUP-HELP eCAF. 103. All providers that receive an allocation of STARTUP-HELP places will be granted access in the\n\nHELP IT System (HITS) to offer this new loan type.

You’ll need that\n\npassion to endure The Struggle and to recruit e[ectively. Aptitude means the world needs you to do it. The\n\nworld needs you somewhere, \\nd where. ROADMAP TO STARTUP SUCCESS\n\nGot the passion and the aptitude? Then starting a startup may\n\nbe your true calling. But, you’ll need some guidelines to help\n\nyou ]ourish. 10\n\nHow to Start a Startup\n\nAccording to Altman, the \\rst two things you need to\n\nmaximize startup success are:\n\n1. A great idea\n\n2. A great product\n\nFINDING YOUR GREAT IDEA\n\nAltman said that no matter how well you execute it, a bad\n\nidea will get you nowhere. This is where a lot of founders drop the ball. There’s this\n\npervasive rhetoric in startup culture that it’s feasible to start\n\nyour business with a bad idea. That maybe, if you pivot\n\nenough, it’ll all work out in the end. But Altman said this is\n\nnot a good move because it doesn’t actually work out. If your startup succeeds, chances are you’ll be working on\n\nit for 10 years — if it fails, the timeline is more like \\ve\n\nyears. If you’re going to be in it to see your idea through to\n\nsuccess, it’s essential that you seriously mull it over and nail\n\ndown your mission. The best companies are mission-oriented. With a solid\n\nmission in place, you’ll get a more motivated team that will\n\nrally around you. HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A GREAT IDEA? You can answer the question: Why now? Why is this\n\nthe perfect time for this particular idea instead of two years\n\nago or two years from now? 11\n\nThinkApps\n\nYou’re building something you yourself need. (If not,\n\nget really close to your customers.)\n\nBUILDING A GREAT PRODUCT\n\nAfter the idea stage, the next step is building an amazing\n\nproduct. Altman said that looking at market growth is key. You need\n\na market that’s going to evolve in 10 years. And it’s better to\n\nhave a small but rapidly growing market, instead of a large\n\nbut slowly growing market. Build something that a small number of users love, not just\n\nlike. If customers are pretty desperate for a solution, then\n\nthey’ll settle on the \\rst product even if it’s subpar. If your\n\ncustomers love your product, your startup will grow by word\n\nof mouth."

        "By the 20th century, the complexity of modern corporations demanded a cadre of executives trained to administer large companies. In 1908, Harvard awarded the first master of business administration (MBA) degree to fill the need to bring professional education standards to big business. The MBA curriculum standardized and codified the essential elements an operating executive in a modern company needed to know: cost accounting, strategy, finance, product management, engineering, personnel management and operations. Formal management tools are about 100 years old. Fast-forward to the mid-20th century. The pairing of venture capital and startup entrepreneurship emerged in its modern form, and the startup industry they fostered has been exploding ever since. Yet for the past 50 years, finding the successful formula for repeatable startup success has remained a black art. Founders have continually struggled with and adapted the “big business” tools, rules and processes taught in business schools and suggested by their investors. Investors have been shocked when startups failed to execute “the plan,” never admitting to the entrepreneurs that no startup executes to its business plan. Today, after half a century of practice, we know unequivocally that the traditional MBA curriculum for running large companies like IBM, GM and Boeing does not work in startups. In fact, it’s toxic. With the benefit of hindsight, entrepreneurs now understand the problem, namely that startups are not simply smaller versions of large companies. Companies execute business models where customers, their problems, and necessary product features are all “knowns.” In sharp contrast, startups operate in “search” mode, seeking a repeatable and profitable\n\nbusiness model. The search for a business model requires dramatically different rules, roadmaps, skill sets, and tools in order to minimize risk and optimize chances for success. By the beginning of the 21st century, entrepreneurs, led by web and mobile startups, began to seek and develop their own management tools. Now, a decade later, a radically different set of startup tools has emerged, distinct from those used in large companies but as comprehensive as the traditional “MBA Handbook.” The result is the emerging “science of entrepreneurial management.” My first book, The Four Steps to the Epiphany, was one of its first texts. It recognized that the classic books about large-company management were ill-suited for early-stage ventures. It offered a reexamination of the existing product-introduction process and delineated a radically different method that brings customers and their needs headfirst into the process long before the launch. We are building the first management tools specifically for startups. At the time I wrote it, the book was my proposed methodology for getting startups right. But just as it was published, agile engineering became the preferred product-development method. This iterative and incremental method created a need and a demand for a parallel process to provide rapid and continual customer feedback. The Customer Development process I articulated in The Four Steps fit that need perfectly. Over the past decade, thousands of scientists, engineers and MBAs in my classes at Stanford’s engineering school and U.C. Berkeley’s Haas School of Business—plus those sponsored by the National Science Foundation—have discussed, deployed, assessed and enhanced the Customer Development process. It has since been implemented by tens of thousands of entrepreneurs, engineers, and investors worldwide. While the fundamental, powerful “Four Steps” remain at its core, this book is far more than a second edition. Nearly every step in the process, and in fact the entire approach, have been enhanced and refined based on a decade of Customer Development experience. Customer development is paired with agile product\n\ndevelopment. Even more gratifying: now, a decade later, multiple books and authors, are filling shelves in the newly created section for the strategy and science of entrepreneurship. Some of the other areas in this emerging field of entrepreneurial management are:\n\nagile development, an to incremental and engineering that enables product or service development to iterate and pivot to customer and market feedback\n\ninteractive approach\n\nbusiness model design, which replaces static business plans with a nine- box map of the key elements that make up a company\n\ncreativity and innovation tools for creating and fostering winning ideas\n\nthe Lean Startup, an intersection of customer and agile development\n\nlean user interface design to improve web/mobile interfaces and conversion rates\n\nventure and entrepreneurial finance, to attract and manage funds that fuel the innovation\n\nNo one book, including this one, offers a complete roadmap or all the answers for entrepreneurs. Yet together, the texts in the entrepreneurial management science library offer entrepreneurs guidance where none existed before. Startups, driven by potential markets measured in billions of people, will use this body of knowledge to test, refine and scale their ideas far faster and more affordably than ever. No one book, including this one, offers a complete roadmap... My co-author Bob and I hope books like this one help speed the startup\n\nrevolution and enhance its success—and yours. Steve Blank Pescadero, Calif., March 2012\n\nWho Is This Book For? THIS BOOK IS FOR ALL ENTREPRENEURS and uses the term startup literally hundreds of times. But what exactly is a startup? A startup is not a smaller version of a large company. A startup is a temporary organization in search of a scalable, repeatable, profitable business model. At the outset, the startup business model is a canvas covered with ideas and guesses, but it has no customers and minimal customer knowledge. But we’ve only defined the words startup, entrepreneur, and innovation halfway. These words mean different things in Silicon Valley, on Main Street, and in Corporate America. While each type of startup is distinct, this book offers guidance for each one. A startup is a temporary organization in search of a scalable, repeatable, profitable business model. Small Business Entrepreneurship: In the United States, the majority of entrepreneurs and startups are found among 5.9 million small businesses that make up 99.7 percent of all U.S. companies and employ 50 percent of all nongovernment workers. These are often service-oriented businesses like drycleaners, gas stations and convenience stores, where entrepreneurs define success as paying the owners well and making a profit, and they seldom aspire to take over an industry or build a $100 million business. Scalable startups are the work of traditional technology entrepreneurs. These entrepreneurs start a company believing their vision will change the world and result in a company with hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in sales. The early days of a scalable startup are about the search for a repeatable and scalable business model. Scale requires external venture- capital investment in the tens of millions to fuel rapid expansion. Scalable startups tend to cluster in technology centers such as Silicon Valley, Shanghai, New York, Bangalore, and Israel and make up a small percentage of entrepreneurs, but their outsize return potential attracts almost all the risk\n\ncapital (and press). Scalable Startup (Figure i.1)\n\n“Buyable” startups are a new phenomenon. With the extremely low cost of developing web/mobile apps, startups can literally fund themselves on founders’ credit cards and raise small amounts of risk capital, usually less than $1 million. These startups (and their investors) are happy to be acquired for $5 million to $50 million, purchased by larger companies often to acquire the talent as much as the business itself. Large Company Entrepreneurship: Large companies have finite life cycles. Most grow by offering new products that are variants of their core products (an approach known as sustaining innovation). They may also turn to disruptive innovation, attempting to introduce new products into new markets with new customers. Ironically, large companies’ size and culture make disruptive innovation (really an effort to launch a scalable startup inside a big company) extremely difficult to execute. ...large companies’ size and culture make disruptive innovation extremely difficult. Social entrepreneurs build innovative nonprofits to change the world. Customer Development provides them a scorecard for assessing scalability, investment and growth metrics. These asset entrepreneurial ventures seek solutions rather than profits and happen on every continent in areas as diverse as water, agriculture, health, and microfinance. leverage,\n\nreturn on\n\nWhile the Customer Development process helps scalable startups the most, each of these five startup types has entrepreneurship and innovation at its heart. And each improves its chances for finding the right path to success through the use of Customer Development. Who Is This Book Not For? There are cases where using the Customer Development methodology and this book is inappropriate. Early-stage ventures fall into two types: those with customer/market risk\n\nand those with invention risk. Markets with invention risk are those where it’s questionable whether the technology can ever be made to work, but if it does, customers will beat a path to the company’s door. (Think life sciences and cure for cancer.)\n\nMarkets with customer/market risk are those where the unknown is whether customers will adopt the product. For companies building web-based products, product development may be difficult, but with enough time and iteration, Engineering will eventually converge on a solution and ship a functional product—it’s engineering, not invention. The real risk is in whether there is a customer and a market for the product as spec’ed. In these markets it’s all about customer/market risk. There’s a whole other set of markets where the risk is truly invention. These are markets where it may take five or even 10 years to get a product out of the lab and into production (e.g., biotech). Whether it will eventually work, no one knows, but the payoff can be so large that investors will take the risk. In these markets it’s all about invention risk. Startups solve customer and market risk by reading this book. A third type of market has both invention and market risk. For example, complex new semiconductor architectures mean you may not know if the chip performs as well as you thought until you get first silicon. But then, because there might be entrenched competitors and your concept is radically new, you still need to invest in the Customer Development process to learn how to get design wins from companies that may be happy with their existing vendors. Startups solve invention risk by using simulation tools (computational fluid dynamics, finite element analysis, etc.). Startups solve customer and market risk by reading this book."

        "When the issues are customer acceptance and market adoption, this book shows the path. Introduction\n\nA legendary hero is usually the founder of something—the founder of a new age, the founder of a new religion, the founder of a new city, the founder of a new way of life. In order to found something new, one has to leave the old and go on a quest of the seed idea, a germinal idea that will have the potential of bringing forth that new thing. — Joseph Campbell, The Hero with a Thousand Faces\n\nJOSEPH CAMPBELL POPULARIZED THE NOTION of an archetypal “hero’s journey,” a pattern that recurs in the mythologies and religions of cultures around the world. From Moses and the burning bush to Luke Skywalker’s meeting Obi-wan Kenobi, the journey always begins with a hero who hears a calling to a quest. At the outset of the voyage, the path is unclear and no end is in sight. Each hero meets a unique set of obstacles, but Campbell’s keen insight was that the outline of these stories is always the same. There are not a thousand different heroes but one hero with a thousand faces. The hero’s journey is an apt way to think of startups. All new companies and new products begin with a vision—a hope for what could be and a goal few others can see. It’s this bright and burning founder’s vision that differentiates an entrepreneur from a big-company CEO and separates startups from existing businesses. Founding entrepreneurs are out to make their vision and business real. To succeed, they must abandon the status quo, recruit a team that shares their vision, and strike out together on what appears to be a new path, often shrouded in uncertainty, fear and doubt. Obstacles, hardships and potential disaster lie ahead, and their journey to success tests more than financial resources—it tests their stamina, agility, and courage. Take a new path, often shrouded in uncertainty, fear, and doubt. Every entrepreneur is certain his or her journey is unique. Each travels down the startup path without a roadmap and believes that no model or template could possibly apply. What makes some startups successful while others sell off the furniture often seems like luck. But it isn’t. As Campbell suggests, the outline is always the same. The path to startup success is well- traveled and well-understood. There is a true and repeatable path to success. This book charts that path. A Repeatable Path\n\nIn the last quarter of the 20th century, startups thought they knew the correct path for the startup journey. They adopted a methodology for product development, launch, and life-cycle management almost identical to the processes taught in business schools for use in large companies. These processes provide detailed business plans, checkpoints and goals for every step toward getting a product out the door—sizing markets, estimating sales, developing marketing-requirements documents, prioritizing product features. Yet at the end of the day, even with all these processes, the embarrassing fact is that in companies large and small, established corporate giants as well as new startups, more than nine of 10 new products fail. It’s true in every product category—high-tech or low, online or off, consumer or business— well-funded or not. Even after decades of similar failures, investors are always surprised when a new venture fails to execute its business “plan.” And still they continue to rely on the same product-introduction processes. We now know what the problem is. Startups have been using tools appropriate for executing a known business. But startups are all about unknowns. To find the path to build a winning startup, entrepreneurs must try a new way:\n\nWinners throw out the traditional product management and introduction processes they learned at existing companies. Instead, they combine agile engineering and Customer Development to iteratively build, test and search for a business model, turning unknowns into knowns. Winners also recognize their startup “vision” as a series of untested hypotheses in need of “customer proof.” They relentlessly test for insights, and they course-correct in days or weeks, not months or years, to preserve\n\ncash and eliminate time wasted on building features and products that customers don’t want. Winners recognize their startup is a series of untested hypotheses. Losers blindly execute a rigid product management and introduction methodology. They assume that the founder’s vision drives the business strategy and product development plans and that all they need to do is to raise funds for execution. Founders, not employees, must search for a business model. The best way to search is for the founders themselves to get out of the building to gain a deep, personal, firsthand understanding of their potential customers’ needs before locking into a specific path and precise product specs. That’s the difference between winners and losers."

        "It’s also the Customer Development process detailed in this book. Why a Second Decade? Startups have now been using Customer Development for a decade, since the initial publication of The Four Steps to the Epiphany. If this is your first contact with the Four Steps, welcome aboard. For the tens of thousands who’ve embraced that first version, The Startup Owner’s Manual offers a great deal more. The first version assumed startups were high-tech ventures in Silicon Valley selling products through a physical sales channel and aiming to be billion-dollar businesses. A lot has happened in 10 years, and this version embraces those changes. For example:\n\nBits: The Second Industrial Revolution\n\nFor thousands of years after the invention of the wheel, a product was a physical object one could touch, such as food, cars, planes, books, and household goods. These physical products reached customers via a physical sales channel: salespeople visiting customers, or customers visiting stores. Figure i.2 shows this intersection of physical products sold through a\n\nphysical channel. Physical Products Sold Through a Physical Channel (Figure i.2)\n\nOne of the breakthroughs in commerce was the invention of products that were ideas or promises that didn’t exist in physical form, such as life and health insurance, stocks and bonds, and commodity futures. In the 1970s, software began to be sold as a product unbundled from any particular computer. The ability to purchase bits was a new concept. By themselves the bits were useless, but when combined with a computer in the form of software applications, bits solved problems or amused people (word processing, balancing checkbooks, game play). These software applications and entertainment, all in the form of bits, were sold to consumers through specialized retail computer stores, a physical channel. Software Products Sold Through Physical Channels (Figure i.3)\n\nStill other software applications were designed to solve problems sales\n\ncompanies had\n\n(database access, manufacturing automation,\n\nautomation), and added the upper right box to Figure i.3, Software Products Sold Through Physical Channels. As the Internet created a new form of sales channel, a new class of company emerged with the value proposition to sell physical products over the Internet. Amazon, Zappos, Dell, and a whole raft of other e-commerce companies filled a new niche: physical products sold via a web channel. This new sales channel created massive disruption in the existing world of physical distribution, as book and music retailers perhaps know best of all. Physical Products in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure i.4)\n\nOver the past decade a new class of product has emerged, where BOTH the product and the channel are bits (see Figure i.5). Startups can now be\n\nbuilt for thousands rather than millions of dollars and in weeks rather than years. As a result, the number of startups founded each year has exploded. New applications such as social networks that duplicate the socialization we once had face-to-face are being mediated via machine. Search engines that scour the web, such as Google and Bing, exist only in bits, in a web/mobile channel. More important, entire industries that started by selling physical products in physical locations have begun their migration to bits sold over the Internet. Originally, people sold books, music, videos, movies, travel, and stocks and bonds either face-to-face or in storefronts. Those channels are either radically transformed or disappearing as physical products turn into bits. Software Products In Web/Mobile Channels (Figure i.5)\n\nSpeed, Time and Iterations: the “Second Industrial\n\nRevolution”\n\nRegardless of the business, any enterprise focused on the bottom righthand box in Figure i.2—Physical Goods Sold through a Physical Channel—has discovered over the past decade that the old rules and tools for physical businesses and channels no longer apply. They’ve learned that the closer a company gets to a web/mobile channel and a web/mobile product, the faster it can change, test and optimize both product and offer. They need a new process to quickly adapt to the new freedoms a web/mobile channel and product allow, and they’ve found it in Customer Development. The Customer Development process gathers customer feedback about product, channel, price, and positioning, all of which can be modified and tested in near-real time, and uses it as immediate feedback to iterate and optimize. As a result, web/mobile channel startups can move forward at “Internet speed,” an impossibility with physical distribution channels and products. A mere decade ago, getting feedback on the features of a video game required recruiting focus groups to come in and play the game while being observed through one-way mirrors. Today, companies like Zynga test and tune the features of their online games in days. Are sales slow because the game is too hard? You can adjust the scoring or other game variables and change the product itself quicker than you can say touchdown. Customer Development is the process to organize the search for the business model. Theoretically, when startups’ products and channels are bits, they can gather and act on information 100 times faster than companies delivering physical goods via physical sales channels (10 times the number of iterative learning cycles, each using only 10 percent of the cash.) In fact, companies like Facebook, Google, Groupon, and Zynga grew faster in a decade than most industrial corporations grew in the 20th century. That’s why we call it the Second Industrial Revolution. The Four Steps: A New Path\n\nThe core of Customer Development is blissfully simple: Products developed by founders who get out in front of customers early and often, win. Products handed off to sales and marketing organizations that are only tangentially involved in the new-product development process will lose. There are no facts inside your building, so get the heck outside. Getting out of the building means acquiring a deep understanding of customer needs and combining that knowledge with incremental and iterative product development. The mix of Customer Development and Agile engineering dramatically increases the odds of new product and company success, while reducing the need for upfront cash and eliminating wasted time, energy, money and effort. There are no facts inside your building, so get the heck outside. Customer Development recognizes the startup’s mission as a relentless search to refine its vision and idea, and to make changes in every aspect of the business invalidated during the search process. An entrepreneur seeks to test a series of unproven hypotheses (guesses) about a startup’s business model: who the customers are, what the product features should be, and how this scales into a hugely successful company. Customer Development recognizes a startup is a temporary organization built to search for the answers to what makes a repeatable and scalable business model. Customer Development is the process to organize that search. CHAPTER 1\n\nThe Path to Disaster: A Startup Is Not a Small Version of a Big Company\n\nThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. —Albert Einstein\n\nWHILE THIS STORY IS OLD, ITS LESSONS are timeless. In the heyday of the dot- com bubble at the end of the 20th century, Webvan stood out as one of the most electrifying new startups, with an idea that would potentially touch every household in America. Raising one of the largest financial war chests ever seen (more than $800 million), the company aimed to revolutionize the $450 billion retail grocery business with online ordering and same-day door- to-door grocery delivery. Webvan believed this was one of the first “killer applications” for the Internet. Customers could just point, click, and order. Webvan’s CEO told Forbes magazine that Webvan would “set the rules for the largest consumer sector in the economy.”\n\nBeyond amassing megabucks, the Webvan entrepreneurs seemed to do everything right. Backed by experienced venture-capital investors, the company raced to build vast automated warehouses and bought fleets of delivery trucks while building an easy-to-use website. Webvan hired a seasoned CEO from the consulting industry. What’s more, most initial customers actually liked the service. But barely 24 months after the initial public offering, Webvan was bankrupt and out of business. What happened? ...barely 24 months after the initial public offering, Webvan was bankrupt. This was not a failure of execution. Webvan did everything its board and investors asked. In particular, the company fervently followed the traditional new-product introduction model commonly used by most new ventures and embraced the mantras of the time: “first mover advantage” and “get big fast.” Webvan’s failure to ask “where are the customers?” illuminates how this tried-and-true model led one of the best-funded startups of all time down the path to disaster. The Traditional New-Product Introduction Model\n\nIn the 20th century, every company bringing a new product to market used some form of product management model (Figure 1.1). Emerging early in the century, this product-centric model described a process that evolved in manufacturing industries. The consumer packaged-goods industry adopted it in the 1950s, and it spread to the technology business in the last quarter of the century. There it became an integral part of the startup culture. At first glance, the new-product introduction model outlined in the diagram at right appears to be helpful and benign. It illustrates the process of getting a new product into the hands of waiting customers. A new product moves from development to customer testing (alpha/beta test), and using feedback from this initial testing, the product engineers fix technical errors in the product until the product launch date and first customer ship. The new-product introduction model is a good fit for an existing company where the customers are known, the product features can be spec’ed upfront, the market is well-defined, and the basis of competition is understood. New Product Introduction Diagram (Figure 1.1)\n\nAs for startups, a scant few fit these criteria. Few even know who their customers are. Yet many persist in using the new-product introduction model not only to manage product development but as a roadmap for finding customers and setting the timing for the startup’s sales, launch and revenue plans. Investors use the new-product introduction diagram to set and plan funding. All parties involved in the startup use a roadmap leading toward a very different location, yet they’re surprised to end up lost. What’s wrong with the old model, and how did it contribute to the\n\nbillion-dollar Webvan implosion? Concept and Seed Stage\n\nAt the concept and seed stage, founders capture their passion and vision for the company, sometimes on the back of a napkin, and turn them into a set of key ideas, which becomes the outline for the business plan."

        "Next, issues surrounding the product are defined. What is the product or service concept? What are the product features and benefits? Can it be built? Is further technical research needed? Who will the customers be, and where will they be found? Statistical and market research and a few customer interviews fuel the evaluation and business plan. This step also brings forth a first guess at how the product will ultimately reach including discussions of competitive differences, distribution channels, and costs. An initial positioning chart explains the company and its benefits to venture capitalists or corporate higher-ups. The business plan now gets market-size, competitive and financial sections, with an appendix containing Excel spreadsheets forecasting revenue and expenses. Creative writing, passion and shoe leather combine in the concept and seed phase in hopes of convincing an investor to fund the company or the new division. the customer,\n\nOnce a waterfall process starts, the proverbial train has left the station...

In the next two years, additional private rounds totaling an unbelievable $393 million followed before the company’s IPO."

        "The respective departments go to their figurative corners as the company begins to specialize by function. Marketing refines the size of the market defined in the business plan and begins to target the first customers. In a well-organized startup (one with a fondness for process), the marketing folk might even run a focus group or two on the market they think they’re in and work with Product Management on a market requirements document (MRD) for engineering to specify the product’s final features and functions. Marketing starts to build a sales demo, writes sales materials (websites, presentations, data sheets), and hires a pr agency. In this stage, or by alpha test, the company traditionally hires a VP of Sales. Meanwhile, Engineering focuses on specifying and then building the product. The simple box labeled “Product Development” typically expands into a “waterfall” or “spiral” or incremental process of interlacing steps, all focused on minimizing development risk of a defined feature set (Figure 1.2). This process starts with the founder’s vision, which may be expanded into an MRD (and a product requirements document), and expands further into detailed engineering specifications. With those in hand, Engineering begins implementation fueled by cold pizza and long nights and weekends. Once a waterfall process starts, the proverbial train has left the station and the product is nearly impossible to revise. As a rule, the “train” can run almost nonstop for 18 or perhaps 24 months or more, uninterrupted by changes or new ideas no matter how good they might be for the business. The Product Development “Waterfall” Model (Figure 1.2)\n\nIn Webvan’s case, Engineering moved along two fronts: building the automated warehouses and designing the website. The automated warehouses were a technological marvel, with automated conveyors and carousels transporting food items off the shelves to workers who packed them for delivery. Webvan also designed its own inventory, warehouse, and route management systems and software to manage the entire customer order and\n\ndelivery process. This software communicated with the Webvan website and issued order-fulfillment instructions to the distribution center. Once a delivery was scheduled, the system’s custom route-planning feature determined the most efficient route for delivering the goods to customers’ homes. At the same time, planning began for a marketing and promotion program designed to strengthen the Webvan brand name, get customers to try the service in the first target market, build strong customer loyalty, and maximize repeat usage and purchases. The plan was to build Webvan’s brand name (down to stickering every cup holder in San Francisco’s AT&T Park) and customer through public relations programs, advertising campaigns and promotional activities. Spending for all these activities was part of the business plan. loyalty\n\nAlpha/Beta Test\n\nIn stage three, the alpha/beta test, Engineering continues building along the classic waterfall development model, working toward the first customer ship date. And, by beta test time, working with a small group of outside users to test the product and ensure that it works as specified. Marketing develops a complete marketing communications plan, sets up the corporate website, provides Sales with a full complement of support materials, and starts the public relations bandwagon rolling. The pr agency polishes the positioning and starts contacting the long-lead-time press and blogs, while Marketing starts the branding activities. Sales signs up the first beta customers (who may volunteer to pay for the privilege of testing a new product), begins to build the selected distribution channel, and staffs and scales the sales organization outside headquarters. The sales VP works toward achieving the revenue plan as specified in the business plan. Investors and board members start measuring progress by the number of orders in place by first customer ship."

        "The CEO hits the streets and the phone or the parent-company headquarters, searching for additional capital. Webvan began to beta-test its grocery delivery service in May 1999 with about 1,100 customers. At the same time, the marketing buzz started with a pr blitz with hundreds of articles touting the newest entrant in the online grocery business. Private investors poured hundreds of millions of dollars\n\ninto the company. Product Launch and First Customer Ship\n\nWith the product working (sort of), the company goes into “big-bang” spending mode. The product and the company are launched. The company has a large press event, and Marketing launches a series of programs to create end-user demand. In anticipation of sales, the company hires a national sales organization; the sales channel has quotas and sales goals. The board begins measuring company performance based on sales execution against its business plan, albeit one typically written at least a year earlier, when the company first sought investment. Building a sales channel and supporting marketing burn a lot of cash. Assuming no early liquidity event for the company, more fund-raising is often required. The CEO looks at the product-launch activities and the scale- up of the sales and marketing team and goes out yet again, palm up, to the investor community. (In the dot-com bubble economy, investors used an IPO at product launch to take the money and run, before there was a track record of success or failure.) This operational model no doubt sounds familiar to many: a product- and process-centric model used by countless startups to take their first products to market. Webvan launched its first regional web store in June 1999 (just a month after starting beta test) and filed for its public offering 60 days later. The company raised $400 million and had a market capitalization of $8.5 billion the day of its IPO—larger than the market cap of the top three grocery chains combined. The elation was short-lived. The 9 Deadly Sins of the New Product Introduction Model\n\nFor new products like Webvan, the business plan fails as a roadmap because both the product and the customer are unknown. For most startups, these nine flawed assumptions are the most toxic of all:\n\n1. Assuming “I Know What the Customer Wants”\n\nFirst is the founder’s unwavering belief that he or she understands who the customers will be, what they need, and how to sell it to them. Any dispassionate observer would recognize that on Day One, a startup has no customers, and unless the founder is a true domain expert, he or she can only guess about the customer, problem, and business model. On Day One, a startup is a faith-based initiative built on guesses. Yet the traditional product introduction methodology has founders take these many business model guesses as facts and go design a product and start spending money to build it on a race to “first customer ship”—all before talking to a single customer. On Day One, a startup is a faith-based initiative... To succeed, founders need to turn hypotheses or guesses into facts as soon as possible by getting out of the building, asking customers if the hypotheses were correct, and quickly changing those that were wrong."
    ],
    [
        "2. The “I Know What Features to Build” Flaw\n\nThe second flawed assumption is implicitly driven by the first. Founders, presuming they know their customers, assume they know all the features customers need. These founders specify, design, and build a fully featured product using classic product development methods without ever leaving their building. But wait—isn’t that what startups should do? No—that’s what companies with existing customers do. ...it’s unknown whether the features appeal to customers. The waterfall development process proceeds sequentially and without interruption for as long as a year or two. Progress is measured by each new line of code written or new piece of hardware built throughout the process until the product is released. Yet without direct and continuous customer contact, it’s unknown whether the features appeal to customers. Fixing the inevitable product mistakes after building and shipping the entire product is costly and time-consuming, if not deadly. It can render the product obsolete by launch. Worse, it often causes huge engineering waste, with hundreds of hours of work tossed aside, or tons of code cut and dropped to the floor, when customers say the new features aren’t ones they care about. Ironically, startups were often crippled by the very methodology they traditionally used to build new products. 3. Focus on Launch Date\n\nThe traditional product introduction model focuses engineering, sales and marketing on the all-important, immovable launch date. Marketing tries to pick an “event” (trade show, conference, blog, etc.) where they can “launch” the product. Executives look at that date and the calendar, working backward to ignite fireworks on the day the product is launched. Neither management nor investors tolerate “wrong turns” that result in delays. In fact, traditional engineering schedules have test cycles with the names alpha, beta, and release but rarely allow time to improve the product. They’re still geared to putting out the original product with minimal bugs, though. The product launch and first customer ship dates are merely the dates when a product development team thinks the product’s first release is “finished.” It doesn’t mean the company understands its customers or how to market or sell to them, yet in almost every startup, ready or not, departmental clocks are set irrevocably to “first customer ship.” Even worse, a startup’s investors are managing their financial expectations by this date as well. The chorus of investor voices says, “Why, of course that’s what you do."

        "Getting the product to market is what sales and marketing people do in startups. That’s how a startup makes money.” This is deadly advice. Ignore it. Focusing only on launch results in a “fire, ready, aim” strategy that ignores the customer discovery process—a fundamental and generally fatal error. Obviously, every startup or company wants to get a product to market and sell it, but that can’t be done until the company understands who it’s selling to and why they’ll buy. The forced march ignores the iterative loop that says, “If our assumptions are wrong, maybe we need to try something different.” It shuts off the “build, test and learn” flow and assumes that customers will come based merely on good engineering execution. Time after time, only after launch does a startup discover that not enough customers visit its website, play the game, bring their friends, or convert to orders. Or it discovers that early customers don’t scale into a mainstream market, or the product doesn’t solve a high-value problem, or the cost of distribution is too high. While those discoveries are bad enough, the startup is now burdened with an expensive, scaled-up sales and marketing organization—effective only at burning mountains of cash—that’s now trying to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. At Webvan, the dot-com mania may have intensified the company’s drive to launch, but its single-minded focus was typical of most startups. At first customer ship, Webvan had close to 400 employees. It hired more than 500 more during the next six months. By May 1999, the company had opened its first $40 million distribution center, built and scaled for a customer base it could only guess at, and it had committed to 15 other distribution centers of the same size. Why? Because the Webvan business plan said to do so, regardless of whether the customers agreed. 4. Emphasis on Execution Instead of Hypotheses, Testing, Learning, and Iteration\n\nStartup cultures emphasize “get it done, and get it done fast.” So it’s natural that heads of engineering, sales and marketing all believe they are hired for what they know how to do, not what they can learn. They assume that their experience is relevant to this new venture and that all they need do is put that knowledge to work managing the execution that’s worked for them before. While established companies execute business models where customers, problems, and necessary product features are all knowns, startups need to operate in a “search” mode as they test and prove every one of their initial\n\nhypotheses. They learn from the results of each test, refine the hypothesis and test again, all in search of a repeatable, scalable and profitable business model. Relentless execution without knowing what to execute is a crime. In practice, startups begin with a set of initial hypotheses (guesses), most of which will end up being wrong. Therefore, focusing on execution and delivering a product or service based on those initial, untested hypotheses is a going-out-of-business strategy. In contrast, the traditional product introduction model assumes that building a startup is a step-by-step, sequential, execution-oriented process. Each step unfolds in a logical progression that can be captured in a PERT chart (a project management technique that maps the steps and time required for project completion), with milestones and resources assigned for the completion of each step. But anyone who has ever taken a new product out to a set of potential customers knows that a good day in front of customers is two steps forward and one step back. The ability to learn from these missteps distinguishes a successful startup from those that have vanished. Like all startups focused on executing to a sequential product introduction plan, Webvan hired vice presidents of merchandising, marketing and product management—all oriented around executing a given sales and marketing strategy instead of listening to customers and discovering customer needs. Sixty days after first customer ship, those three VPs employed more than 50 people. The ability to learn from missteps distinguishes a successful startup."

        "5. Traditional Business Plans Presume No Trial and No Errors\n\nThe one great advantage of the traditional product development model: it provides boards and founders an unambiguous path with clearly defined milestones the board presumes will be achieved. Most engineers know what alpha test, beta test, and first customer ship mean. If the product fails to work, everyone stops to fix it. In stark contrast, before first customer ship, sales and marketing activities are ad hoc and fuzzy, and seldom have measurable, concrete objectives. They lack any way to stop and fix what’s broken (and don’t even know if it’s broken or how to stop). Financial progress is tracked using metrics like income statement, balance sheet and cash flow even when there’s no revenue to measure. In reality, none of these are useful for startups. Board directors have simply adopted the traditional metrics used in large companies with existing customers and known business models. In a startup, these metrics don’t track progress against the startup’s only goal: to find a repeatable and scalable business model. Instead, traditional metrics get in the way. Instead of asking, “How many days to the beta test?” or, “What’s in our sales pipeline?” a startup’s board and management team need to ask specific questions about results of its long list of tests and experiments to validate all components of its business model. If a startup’s board of directors isn’t asking these kinds of questions, it’s wasting time without adding value. No matter what, directors and founders must stay focused on one financial metric that always matters: cash burn rate and number of months’ worth of cash left in the bank. If a startup’s board of directors isn’t asking these kinds of questions, it’s wasting time... Webvan had no milestones saying, “Stop and evaluate the launch results.” Otherwise, it might have noticed the stark contrast between the 2,000 daily orders it was getting and the 8,000 in the business-plan forecast. Before any meaningful customer feedback was in hand and only a month after shipping began, Webvan signed a $1 billion deal (yes, $1,000,000,000) with Bechtel to build 26 additional distribution centers over the next three years. 6."

        "Confusing Traditional Job Titles with What a\n\nStartup Needs to Accomplish\n\nMost startups have simply borrowed job titles from established companies. But remember, these are jobs in an organization that’s executing a known business model. The title Sales in an existing company reflects a team repeatedly selling a known product to a well-understood group of customers with standard presentations, prices, terms, and conditions. Startups by definition have few if any of these known elements. In fact, they’re out searching for them! Because target customers, product specs and product presentations may change daily, early-stage startup executives need dramatically different skills from executives who are working in an established company selling established products or line extensions. The demands of customer discovery require people who are comfortable with change, chaos, and learning from failure and are at ease working in risky, unstable situations without a roadmap. In short, startups should welcome the rare breed generally known as entrepreneurs. They’re open to learning and discovery—highly curious, inquisitive, and creative."

        "They must be eager to search for a repeatable and scalable business model. Agile enough to deal with daily change and operating “without a map.” Readily able to wear multiple hats, often on the same day, and comfortable celebrating failure when it leads to learning and iteration. Webvan’s CEO and VPs all came from large-company backgrounds and experience. They were surprised and uncomfortable with the chaos of a startup and tried to solve the problem by scaling the company rapidly. ...measuring progress against a product launch or revenue plan is simply false progress. 7. Sales and Marketing Execute to a Plan\n\nHiring VPs and execs with the right titles but the wrong skills leads to further startup trouble as high-powered sales and marketing people arrive on the payroll to execute the “plan.” Here’s how it typically unfolds:\n\nFollowing the business plan and the traditional product introduction model, the board and founders agree to a launch date, a burn rate, a revenue plan and a set of milestones. The sales VP begins to hire the core sales team, design sales pitches, and make appointments and attempts to acquire early “lighthouse” customers (prominent customers who will attract others). At the same time, the sales team uses revenue goals specified in the business plan to track its progress in understanding customers. Meanwhile, the marketing VP is busy designing websites, logos, presentations, data sheets and collateral, and hiring pr agencies to create buzz. These tactics become marketing objectives, even though they’re merely tactics. Marketing discovers whether its positioning, messaging, pricing and demand-creation activities will work only after first customer ship. Executives and board members accustomed to measurable signs of progress against “the plan” will focus on these execution activities because this is what they know how to do (and what they believe they were hired to do). Of course, in established companies with known customers and markets, this focus makes sense. And even in some startups in “existing markets,” where customers and markets are known, it might work. But in a majority of startups, measuring progress against a product launch or revenue plan is simply false progress, since it transpires in a vacuum absent real customer feedback, instead of searching for an understanding of customers and their problems and replacing assumptions with facts. Webvan set off on this kind of plan-driven “marketing death march.” In its first six months, it acquired an impressive 47,000 new customers, but 71 percent of its 2,000 daily orders were repeat orders, which meant Webvan needed to quickly secure many more new customers and reduce its high customer attrition rate. Making matters worse, Webvan had scaled its spending based on unverified and, it turned out, highly optimistic marketing guesses. 8. Presumption of Success Leads to Premature Scaling\n\nThe business plan, its revenue forecast, and the product introduction model assume that every step a startup takes proceeds flawlessly and smoothly to the next. The model leaves little room for error, learning, iteration or\n\ncustomer feedback. Nothing says, “Stop or slow down hiring until you understand customers,” or, “pause to process customer feedback.” Even the most experienced executives are pressured to hire and staff per the plan regardless of progress. This leads to the next startup disaster: premature scaling. In large companies, the mistakes just have additional zeros in them. Hiring and spending should accelerate only after sales and marketing have become predictable, repeatable, scalable processes—not when the plan says they’re scheduled to begin (or when the “lighthouse” account is signed or a few sales are made). In large companies, the mistakes just have additional zeros in them. Microsoft and Google, powerhouses though may they be, launch product after product—Google’s Orkut and Wave, Deskbar, Dodgeball, Talk and Finance; Microsoft’s “Kin,” Vista, Zune, “Bob,” WebTV, MSNTV, PocketPC—on rigid schedules driven by “the model” and the presumption of success. Shortly thereafter, a lack of customer response delivers a fast, quiet funeral for product and management alike. At Webvan, premature scaling permeated a company culture dominated by the prevailing venture-capital mantra of the time, “get big fast.” It spent $18 million to develop proprietary software and $40 million to set up its first automated warehouse before it had shipped a single item. Premature scaling had dire consequences, assuring that the Webvan case will be taught in business schools for decades to come. As customer demand failed to live up to Webvan’s business plan, the company slowly realized it had overbuilt and overdesigned. While Webvan had executed to its plan, it had also failed to pay attention to its customers. ...no business plan survives first contact with customers. 9. Management by Crisis Leads to a Death Spiral\n\nAt Webvan, the consequences of all the mistakes began to show by the time of first customer ship. The story usually unfolds like this:\n\nSales starts to miss its numbers and the board becomes concerned. The sales VP arrives at a board meeting, still optimistic, and provides a set of reasonable explanations. The board raises a collective eyebrow. The VP returns to the field to exhort the troops to work harder. Sales asks Engineering to build custom versions of the product for special customers, since this is the only way that the increasingly desperate sales force can close the sale. Board meetings become increasingly tense. Shortly thereafter, the sales VP is probably terminated as part of the “solution.”\n\nA new sales VP hired and quickly concludes that the company just didn’t understand its customers or how to sell them. She decides that the company’s positioning and marketing strategy were incorrect and that the product was missing critical features. Since the new sales VP was hired to “fix” sales, the marketing department must now respond to a sales manager who believes that whatever was created earlier in the company was wrong. (After all, it got the old VP fired, right?) A new sales plan buys the new sales VP a few months’ honeymoon. Sometimes all it takes is one or two iterations to find the right sales roadmap and positioning to attract exuberant customers. In tougher times, when dollars are tighter, the next round of funding may never come. But the problem at Webvan was not an incorrect sales strategy or positioning statement. The problem is that no business plan survives first contact with customers. The assumptions in the Webvan business plan were simply a series of untested hypotheses. When real results came in, they learned that the guesses in their revenue plan were wrong. Focusing on executing their business plans, Webvan iterated their strategy and their search for a business model by firing executives. Failure is an integral part of the search for a business model. Webvan went public in 1999, and its sea of red ink was reported quarterly for all to see. Rather than acknowledge its unrealistic plan and scale back or retrench, the company kept spending against its flailing strategy, accumulating a $612 million deficit in the process. Seven months after its\n\nIPO, Webvan filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The ironic Webvan postscript: two other companies on two continents saw the same opportunity at the same time but developed their businesses by following Customer Development precepts even though they hadn’t been published at the time. Peapod and Tesco are both successful, growing, and today. They started smaller, without carving hypothetical profitable assumptions and plans in stone, and learned what customers wanted as they developed business and financial models that worked. Tesco, a UK company that used retail stores as its launch pad and “warehouse,” today delivers more than 85,000 orders a week and earns more than $559 million in sales. Peapod, an American company, has delivered more than 10 million grocery orders to more than 330,000 customers. Explicitly or implicitly, both understood the test-and-iterate process of Customer Development.

Steve had invested in Will’s previous company, There.com, and sat on its board. Before that, Will had been Steve’s engineering VP at Rocket Science, a video-game company with Steve as founding CEO. Rocket Science is infamous for appearing on the cover of Wired magazine while blowing through $35 million in venture capital in less than three years, leaving a crater so deep it has its own iridium layer.

He earned his bachelor’s, master’s and Ph.D. in computer science at Stanford while running a video-game company that developed hits like Zany Golf, Immortal, and Marble Madness. Will’s co-founder, Eric Ries, had started an online recruiting company while earning his computer science degree at Yale. Eric had joined Will’s last startup as a senior software engineer. That company built a “virtual world” on the web using a multiyear waterfall development model. After three years, the product was ready to launch with a big-bang product introduction guided by a hired big gun, a CEO with large company experience. Only then did they discover that customers didn’t want or care about most of the features\n\nthey had so painstakingly built. Steve told the IMVU founders that in exchange for his check to help fund their seed round, they were required to audit his Customer Development class at U.C. Berkeley’s Haas Business School. As the semester unfolded, Will and Eric realized that the Customer Development principles they were learning would save them from repeating the same errors they made in their previous startup. Thus IMVU’s co-founders became the first Customer Development pioneers. ...in exchange for his check to help fund IMVU’s seed round, they were required to audit Steve’s Customer Development class. Steve sat on IMVU’s board and watched, coached and cheered as Will and Eric paired the Customer Development process with agile software development. They built a process that used customer feedback and testing to help them determine the minimum product features customers most valued. Based on its initial set of hypotheses about its customer, IMVU set out to create a 3D chat add-on where users could create customizable avatars and talk to all their friends on the leading instant messenger of the day, America Online. After a year, IMVU could see that all its customer hypotheses were wrong. While customers liked the 3D avatars, they wanted to create their own separate buddy lists instead of using the one they already had on AOL. IMVU learned that customers didn’t want to talk to their existing friends but wanted to meet new people and make new friends. Quarter after quarter, this kind of customer feedback created a “two steps forward, one step back” learning process that supplied the Customer Development principles they learned in class. Most startups lack a structured process for testing their business model hypotheses. IMVU tested, pivoted and tested again until it had the product right. Instead of creating a crisis, this learning process was an integral part of the integrated Customer Development and agile company. IMVU had\n\nengineering and had become the first Lean Startup. The result was a profitable, growing company. Why was IMVU on the road to success while scores of other virtual world and avatar companies have long since folded? What was it about Customer Development that gave Will and Eric a clearer roadmap at IMVU than they had at their previous company? An Introduction to Customer Development\n\nOne of the things startups have lacked is a definition of who they were. For years we’ve treated startups like they are just smaller versions of a large company. However, we now know that a startup is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model. Within this definition, a startup can be a new venture or it can be a new division or business unit in an existing company. If your business model is unknown – that is, just a set of untested hypotheses — you are a startup searching for a repeatable business model. Once your business model (market, customers, features, channels, pricing, Get/Keep/Grow strategy, etc.) is known, you will be executing it. Search versus execution is what differentiates a new venture from an existing business unit. Strategy\n\nThe term business model first appeared ~50 years ago, but the concept didn’t catch on until the 1990’s. It became common vernacular to discuss\n\nbusiness models, but without a standard framework and vernacular, confusion reigned. In 2010 when Alexander Osterwalder published his book Business Model Generation he provided a visual ontology and a clear vernacular that was sorely needed, and it became clear that this was the tool to organize startup hypotheses. The primary objective of a startup is to validate its business model hypotheses (and iterate and pivot until it does). Then it moves into execution mode. It’s at this point the business needs an operating plan, financial forecasts and other well-understood management tools. Process\n\nYet as powerful as the Business Model Canvas (a template with the nine blocks of a business model) is, at the end of the day it was a tool for brainstorming hypotheses without a formal way of testing them. The processes used to organize and implement the search for the business model are Customer Development and Agile Development. A search for a business model can be in any new business – in a brand new startup new or in a new division of an existing company. The Customer Development model depicted in Figure 2.1 breaks out all the customer-related activities of an early-stage company into four easy-to- understand steps. The first two steps of the process outline the “search” for\n\nthe business model. Steps three and four “execute” the business model that’s been developed, tested, and proven in steps one and two. The steps:\n\nCustomer discovery first captures the founders’ vision and turns it into a series of business model hypotheses. Then it develops a plan to test customer reactions to those hypotheses and turn them into facts Customer validation tests whether the resulting business model is repeatable and scalable. If not, you return to customer discovery Customer creation is the start of execution. It builds end-user demand and drives it into the sales channel to scale the business Company-building transitions the organization from a startup to a company focused on executing a validated model\n\nIn search, you want a process designed to be dynamic, so you work with a rough business model description knowing it will change. The model changes because startups use customer development to run experiments to test the hypotheses that make up the model. And most of the time these experiments fail. Search embraces failure as a natural part of the startup process. Unlike existing companies that fire executives when they fail to match a plan, we keep the founders and change the model. The specific processes associated with the two search steps are described in the following pages. Once a company has found a business model (it knows its market, customers, product/service, channel, pricing, etc.), the organization moves from search to execution. The product execution process – managing the life cycle of existing products and the launch of follow-on products – is the job of the product management and engineering organizations. It results in a linear process where you make a plan and refine it into detail. The more granularity you add to a plan, the better people can execute it: a Business Requirement document (BRD) leads to a Market Requirements Document (MRD) and then gets handed off to engineering as a Functional Specifications Document (FSD) implemented via Agile or Waterfall development. Organization\n\nSearching for a business model requires a different organization than the one used to execute a plan. Searching requires the company to be organized around a customer development team led by the founders. In contrast, execution (which follows search) requires the company to be organized by function (product management, sales, marketing, business development, etc.). Companies in execution suffer from a “fear of failure culture“ (quite understandable since they were hired to execute a known job spec.) Startups with Customer Development Teams have a “learning and discovery” culture for search. The fear of making a move before the last detail is nailed down is one of the biggest problems existing companies have when they need to learn how to search. The idea of not having a functional organization until the organization has found a proven business model is one of the hardest things for new startups to grasp. There are no sales, marketing or business development departments when you are searching for a business model. If you’ve organized your startup with those departments, you are not really doing customer development. (It’s like trying to implement a startup using Waterfall engineering.)\n\nCustomer Development Process (Figure 2.1)\n\n“The Search for a Business Model:” Steps, Iteration and Pivots\n\nIn the Customer Development model, each step is represented as a circular track with recursive arrows in order to highlight that each step is iterative. It’s a polite way of saying, “Startups are unpredictable. We will have failures and we will screw it up several times before we get it right.”\n\nIn contrast, a traditional product introduction plan makes no provision for moving backward. To do so would be considered a failure. No wonder most startup founders are embarrassed when they’re out in the field learning, failing, and learning some more. The diagram their boards of directors have beaten into them says, “Move from left to right and you’re a success. Go right to left and you’ll get fired.” This is why startup sales and marketing efforts tend to move forward even when it’s patently obvious that they haven’t nailed the market. Experience with scores of startups shows that only in business-school case studies does progress addressing customers’ key needs happen in a smooth, linear fashion. Meanwhile, the Customer Development model embraces the way startups actually work, with moving backward playing a natural and valuable role in learning and discovery. Startups will cycle through each step of the Customer Development process until they achieve “escape velocity”— enough measurable progress in finding the business model as defined by board and team—to propel forward to the next step. ...what could customers tell us except that we were right? Eric Ries recalls his pre-IMVU days at There.com: “The company sort of wanted customer feedback but not really. From our perspective, what could customers tell us except that we were right? The marketing team held focus groups, but looking back, they were orchestrated to get the answers we wanted to hear.” The Customer Development model assumes it will take several iterations of each of the four steps to get it right. The philosophy of “It’s not only OK to screw it up—plan to learn from it” is the core of the process."

        "Note that each of the four steps has a stop sign at its exit. That’s simply a reminder to think through whether enough has been learned to charge ahead to the next step. It’s a place to stop and summarize all the learning and, of course, to candidly assess whether the company has reached “escape\n\nvelocity.”\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each of the four steps of the Customer\n\nDevelopment model. Step 1: Customer Discovery\n\nCustomer discovery translates a founder’s vision for the company into hypotheses about each component of the business model and creates a set of experiments to test each hypothesis. To do this, founders leave guesswork behind and get out of the building to test customer reaction to each hypothesis, gain insights from their feedback, and adjust the business model. Of all the lessons of Customer Development, the importance of getting out of the building and into conversations with your customers is the most critical. Only by moving away from the comforts of your conference room to truly engage with and listen to your customers can you learn in depth about their problems, product features they believe will solve those problems, and the process in their company for recommending, approving and purchasing products. You’ll need these details to build a successful product, articulate your product’s unique differences and propose a compelling reason why your customers should buy it. Customer discovery is not about collecting feature lists from prospective customers or running lots of focus groups. In a startup, the founders define the product vision and then use customer discovery to find customers and a market for that vision. (Read that last sentence again. The initial product specification comes from the founders’ vision, not the sum of a set of focus groups.)\n\nIn a startup, the founders define the product vision and then use customer discovery to find customers and a market for that vision. Customer discovery includes two outside-the-building phases. The first tests customer perception of the problem and the customer’s need to solve it. Is it important enough that the right product will drive significant numbers of customers to buy or engage with the product? The second phase shows\n\ncustomers the product for the first time, assuring that the product (usually a minimum viable product at this point) elegantly solves the problem or fills the need well enough to persuade lots of customers to buy. When customers enthusiastically confirm the importance of both the problem and the solution, customer discovery is complete. Pivots may happen in the customer discovery phase. Failure will happen."

    [
        "Misunderstanding or just getting wrong key assumptions about your business model happen often: who your customers are, what problems they needed to solve, what features would solve them, how much customers would pay to solve them, etc. Pivots are a response to these mistakes. A pivot is a major change to one of the nine business model hypotheses based on learning from customer feedback. Pivots happen often in the Customer Development process. A pivot is not a failure. In fact, embracing the fact that startups regularly fail and pivot along the way is perhaps one of the greatest insights in this book. For web/mobile apps, or products, customer discovery begins when the first “low-fidelity” version of the website or app is up and running. The website is used to test the business model hypotheses against customers or users. When the product is bits, a rough minimum viable product can often be assembled in days if not hours, and entrepreneurs can start the search for customers almost at once, refining their product and customer-acquisition strategies on the fly. This approach served many recent startup stars quite well, including Facebook and Groupon, which began the quest for customers with rough-hewn products almost the day they opened their doors. A pivot is not a failure. Another key element of customer discovery is that the founder is free to ignore all of it. At times (particularly in a new market) a founder’s vision of what can be is clearer than the vision of potential customers. But this corner case requires the founder to be able to articulate the “why,” not just ignore it. The IMVU team shipped a buggy minimalist product quickly and deployed a whopping marketing budget of $5 a day, using Google AdWords to attract roughly 100 new daily users to the site. They vigilantly observed, monitored and assessed every user’s on-site behavior. Heavy (paying) users were then assaulted with questions in online chats, surveys, phone calls from\n\nfounders and more. Perhaps the ugliest (or most flattering) comment: “It seems to crash my computer every time I use it,” said one user who kept coming back for more! But four months after funding, a (clearly minimal) new product was born, using feedback reflecting the power of customer discovery. Step 2: Customer Validation\n\nCustomer validation proves that the business tested and iterated in customer discovery has a repeatable, scalable business model that can deliver the volume of customers required to build a profitable company. During validation, the company tests its ability to scale (i.e., product, customer acquisition, pricing and channel activities) against a larger number of customers with another round of tests, that are larger in scale and more rigorous and quantitative. During this step, a startup also develops a sales roadmap for the sales and marketing teams (to be hired later) or validates the online demand creation plan. Simply put, does adding $1 in sales and marketing resources generate $2+ of revenue (or users, views, clicks, or whatever the metric may be)? The resulting roadmap will be field-tested here by selling the product to early customers. In web/mobile apps, customer validation calls for the deployment of a “hi-fidelity” version of the MVP to test key features in front of customers. Customer validation proves the existence of a set of customers, confirms that customers will accept the MVP, and validates serious, measurable purchase intent among customers. How? Depending on the business model, validation is measured by “test sales” that get customers to hand over their money (or become actively engaged with the product). In a single-sided market (one where the user is the payer), a steady stream of customer purchases validates the concept far more solidly than lots of polite words. There’s no surrogate for people paying for a product. In a “two-sided” or ad-supported business model, a customer base of hundreds of thousands that’s growing exponentially usually implies that the company can find a set of advertisers willing to pay to reach those users. In essence, the first two steps in the Customer Development model— customer discovery and customer validation—refine, corroborate, and test a startup’s business model. Completing these first two steps verifies the\n\nproduct’s core features, the market’s existence, locates customers, tests the product’s perceived value and demand, identifies the economic buyer (the person who writes the check to buy the product), establishes pricing and channel strategies, and checks out the proposed sales cycle and process. Only when an adequately sized group of customers and a repeatable sales process that yields a profitable business model are clearly identified and validated is “escape velocity” achieved. At that point, it’s time to move on to the next step: scaling up, also known as customer creation. Learning that a hypothesis is wrong is not a crisis. In Will’s and Eric’s pre-IMVU startup, their CEO and board forced them to wait three years and spend $30 million to perfect the product with minimal customer feedback. By contrast, IMVU launched a buggy early product roughly 120 days after it was founded. Amazingly, some customers loved the buggy product enough not only to pay for it, but also to give the founders what they wanted: feedback (and money). The IMVU team used customer feedback relentlessly to drive the enhancement, addition and deletion of features that “heavy users” liked or didn’t. One critical pricing discovery led to a 30 percent increase in revenue. When teenagers bemoaned their lack of access to credit cards, IMVU reacted quickly by allowing users to pay IMVU via gift cards distributed through 7- Eleven and Walmart, online, and via other major retail channels. A Customer Development Bonus: Minimum Waste of Cash and Time\n\nThe first two Customer Development steps limit the amount of money a startup spends until it has tested and validated a business model and is ready to scale. Instead of hiring sales and marketing staff, leasing new buildings or buying ads, startup founders get out of the building to test the business model hypotheses, and that costs very little in cash. When paired with agile engineering, Customer Development reduces the amount of wasted code, features or hardware. Agile development builds the product in small increments, allowing the company to test and measure customer reactions to each new iteration of the product. It won’t take three years to find out that customers don’t want or need or can’t use the features the team labored lovingly over. Since the Customer Development model assumes that most startups cycle through discovery and validation multiple times, it allows a well- managed company to carefully estimate and frugally husband its cash. It also helps “husband” founders’ equity, since the closer a company is to a predictable, scalable business model, the higher its likely valuation— preserving more stock for the founders at fundraising time. The IMVU founders, for example, only hired product development teams (not sales, marketing, or business development) until they had proof in hand of a business worth building. With that proof, the company can move through the third and fourth steps, customer creation and company-building, to capitalize on the opportunity. Step 3: Customer Creation\n\nCustomer creation builds on the company’s initial sales success. It’s where the company steps on the gas, spending large sums to scale by creating end- user demand and driving it into the sales channel. This step follows customer validation, moving heavy marketing spending after a startup has learned how to acquire customers, thus controlling the cash burn rate to protect a most precious “green” asset, cash. Customer creation varies by startup type. Some startups enter existing markets well-defined by their competitors, others create new markets where no product or company exists, and still others attempt a hybrid by re- segmenting an existing market as a low-cost entrant or by creating a niche. Each market-type strategy demands different customer creation activities and costs. (Market type is addressed in depth later.)\n\nInitially, IMVU ran a wide range of low-cost customer segmentation experiments. Soon they identified two distinct customer segments—teens and moms—and spending ramped up to underwrite two entirely different customer creation efforts. Step 4: Company-Building\n\n“Graduation day” arrives when the startup finds a scalable, repeatable business model. At this point it’s fundamentally no longer the temporary search-oriented organization known as a startup—it’s a company! In a\n\nsometimes-bittersweet transition out of startup mode, company-building refocuses the team’s energy away from “search” mode and to a focus on execution, swapping its informal learning- and discovery-oriented Customer Development team for formal, structured departments such as Sales, Marketing and Business Development, among others, complete with VPs. These executives now focus on building their departments to scale the company. This is where the entrepreneurs’ version of a Shakespearean tragedy often takes center stage, as VCs realize they have a “hit” with potential for a large return on their investment. All of a sudden, the passionate visionary entrepreneur is no longer deemed the right person to lead the now-successful company he or she has nurtured from cocktail napkin to high-trajectory. The board—graciously or not—ousts the founder and all his or her innate customer understanding, trading him or her in for a “suit,” an experienced operating executive. There goes the neighborhood, as the company declares success, the entrepreneurial spark often sputters, and process often drowns energy. At IMVU, the founders saw the company rapidly scaling beyond their skill set. But instead of being fired, they recognized the need for a seasoned operating executive, recruited a skilled CEO, and named themselves chairmen of the board and active board members."

        "1:\n\nThere Are No Facts Inside Your Building, So Get Outside. On Day One, the startup is a faith-based enterprise built on its founders’ vision and a notable absence of facts. The founders’ job is to translate this vision and these hypotheses into facts. Facts live outside the building, where future customers (prospects, really) live and work, so that’s where you need to go. Nothing is more fundamental to Customer Development, and nothing is harder to do. It’s much easier to write code, build hardware, have meetings and write reports than it is to find and listen to potential customers. But that’s what separates the winners from the losers. Facts live outside the building, where future customers live and work... In Customer Development, the founders gather firsthand experience about every component of the business model.

Employees hate to deliver bad news to higher-ups\n\nEmployees have far less at stake and seldom listen as acutely, and they don’t get heard adequately when they report back. It’s too easy to dismiss their findings as “hearsay” or to ignore critical points of feedback\n\nConsultants have even less at stake than employees and often color their commentary to either tell the client what he wants to hear or deliver messages that can lead to extended consulting relationships.

Customer Development the product development is useless unless organization can iterate the product with speed and agility. If Engineering builds the product using waterfall development, it will be deaf, dumb and blind to customer input except during a short period when it’s specifying the product. The rest of the time, engineers are locked into an implementation cycle, unable to change the product features without intolerable delay. By contrast, a startup engineering organization using an agile methodology is\n\ndesigned to continually take customer input and deliver a product that iterates readily around an MVP or its minimum feature set. In this book, agile engineering/development refers to the rapid deployment, iterative development and continuous discovery processes that hardware or software companies can use. We don’t advocate any particular flavor, just its necessity. The Customer Development process provides the continuous customer input to make agile work. Before the company even starts, the founders need to reach a deep and\n\ninexorable commitment to the customer/agile development partnership."

Failures in an existing company are an exception. They happen when someone screws up. In a startup, you’re searching, not executing, and the only way to find the right path is to try lots of experiments and take a lot of wrong turns. Failure is part of the process. If you’re afraid to fail in a startup, you’re destined to do so. Failures are not truly failures, per se but an integral part of the startup learning process. You’ll be running dozens if not hundreds of pass/fail tests —on your pitch, your features, your pricing, and on and on—so get ready to accept failure and move on. When something isn’t working, successful founders orient themselves to the new facts, decide what needs fixing, and act decisively. The Customer Development process demands frequent, agile iteration, followed, of course, by testing of the iteration that often leads to another iteration or pivot, which leads to more testing and... If you’re afraid to fail in a startup, you’re destined to do so. Rule No. 4:\n\nMake Continuous Iterations and Pivots\n\nThe strategy of embracing failure in Customer Development demands frequent, agile iteration and pivots. A pivot is a substantive change in one or more of the nine boxes of the business model canvas. (For example, a pricing change from freemium to subscription model or a customer segment shift from boys 12-15 years old to women 45-60.) Or it can be more complex, such as a change of target customer or user. Iterations, meanwhile, are minor changes to business model components (e.g., changing pricing from $99 to $79). Groupon’s legendary $12 billion pivot is a perfect example. When a company is limping along, only a dramatic change to one or more business model components can get it back on the road to success. Groupon’s legendary $12 billion pivot (their IPO valuation) is a perfect example. Groupon was started from a company called the Point. It was struggling, at best, as a social media platform working to get people together to solve problems, but was about to run out of money. The most effective campaigns on The Point were those that saved people money by grouping or bundling their purchases. The founders started blogging various deals from different businesses each day. They called this, “Get Your Groupon.com.” Groupon’s first offer hit in October of 2008: buy two pizzas for the price of one in the shop on the first floor of its Chicago headquarters. Twenty people bought the deal and the company was well on its way to its $12-billion pivot. Pivots are driven by the learnings and insight from a continuous stream\n\nof “pass/fail” tests you run throughout discovery and validation.

But once it has delivered fundamentally useless.

In this book, Alexander Osterwalder’s business model canvas serves as the scorecard for the customer discovery process described in Step One. Osterwalder’s book Business Model Generation (Wiley, 2010) provides the structure for the canvas. Business Model Canvas (Figure 3.1)\n\nAs a startup moves through the Customer Development process, it will use the business model canvas as a scorecard, by posting the hypotheses\n\nabout each component of the model and then revising the hypotheses as the founders gather facts. Think of your first version of the business model canvas as the starting point showing the hypotheses that must be confirmed in face-to-face or online interaction with customers. More often than not, the customers will reject components of the business model, saying, “I’d rather buy that from a retailer,” or, “The product needs to have these features to be important to me.” As customers approve or dispute the business model hypotheses, the company either accepts the customers’ approval or pivots to change its business model to better target the opportunity. Using the business model canvas as a guide makes it easier to figure out where and how to pivot, since the team can visually diagram its alternatives and see what it needs to change. Each time the founders iterate or pivot (see Rule No. 4) in response to customer feedback, they draw a new canvas showing the changes. Over time, these multiple canvases form a “flip book” that shows the evolution of the business model. Agile startups can end up with a six-inch-thick stack of business model diagrams they can burn at the IPO-celebration bonfire.

        "7:\n\nAgree on Market Type. It Changes Everything\n\nOne of the radical insights guiding this book is that not all startups are alike. One of the key ways in which they are different is in the relationship between a startup’s new product and its market. These product/market relationships generally fit one of these descriptions:\n\nbringing a new product into an existing market\n\nbringing a new product into a new market\n\nbringing a new product into an existing market and trying to:\n\nre-segment that market as a low-cost entrant or\n\nre-segment that market as a niche entrant\n\ncloning a business model that’s successful in another country\n\nWhat confused entrepreneurs for decades is that the traditional product introduction model works when introducing a product into an existing market with a known business model (i.e., known customers, channels and markets). However, since the majority of startups are not pursuing known markets (those in new or re-segmented categories), they don’t really know who their customers will be. These types of startups are searching for a repeatable and scalable business model. Market type influences everything a company does. Market type influences everything a company does. Strategy and tactics that work for one market type seldom work for another. Market type determines the startup’s customer feedback and acquisition activities and spending. It changes customer needs, adoption rates, product features and\n\npositioning as well as its launch strategies, channels and activities. In sum, different market types require dramatically different discovery, MVPs, and sales and marketing strategies. In existing markets, where customers exist, marketing is relatively easy: users can describe the market and the attributes that matter the most to them. The new product or service typically runs faster, does something better or cheaper, or otherwise improves on a customer-defined attribute. Users, the market, and competitors are known, and competition involves comparing the product and its features with others. In a new market, a company lets customers do something they couldn’t do before by creating something that never existed before. Or it dramatically lowers costs to create a new class of users. By definition, new markets have no customers yet, so there’s nobody to know what the product can do or why they should buy. This makes getting feedback and creating demand particularly challenging, since the product is unknown to users and the market is undefined and unknown, and costly to develop. The key isn’t competing, but instead understanding whether a large customer base exists and whether customers can be persuaded to buy. A classic founder error in a new market is the “fast-burn” spending of sales and marketing funds, a practice that may be appropriate when selling to existing customers in a known market, but makes no sense in a new market. The new- vs.-existing axis is at the core of the market-type definition. Re-segmenting an existing market is useful when the incumbent is too difficult to attack head-on (like Amazon, Facebook, or Microsoft). A re- segmentation strategy is based on the startup’s market and customer knowledge, ideally identifying a market opportunity that incumbents are missing, which usually takes one of two forms: a low-cost strategy or a niche strategy. (Unlike differentiation, segmentation forges a distinct spot in customers’ minds that is unique, valuable, and in demand.)\n\nLow-cost re-segmentation is just what it sounds like. Are there customers at the low end of an existing market who will buy “good enough” performance at a substantially lower price? Niche re-segmentation looks at an existing market and asks whether some segment of this market would buy a new product designed to address more specific needs. Can some sizable portion of the market be convinced that a characteristic of the new product is radical enough to change the rules\n\nand shape of an existing market. See Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne’s work on “Blue Ocean Strategy” for another way to think of re-segmenting a market. Cloning an existing business model is a powerful technique when an existing business has been proven in one country but has not yet been introduced in another. Startups in Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Japan and China (each with its own large local market and language and cultural barriers) can adopt, borrow, or copy a successful American business model and customize it for local language and buying preferences. (Soon ideas from those countries will be cloned in the U.S.)\n\nFor example, Baidu in China and Yandex in Russia are the equivalent of Google in their respective markets. And Qzone, RenRen, PengYou and Kaixin are the Facebooks of China, while Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki play the same role in Russia. Startup companies generally enter one of these four market types and ultimately must commit to one. The consequences of a wrong market-type choice will prove to be severe in the customer creation stage. While market type is ultimately a “late-binding decision,” a working hypothesis helps frame early customer discovery issues. Market-type decision-making is explored in greater detail in Chapter 4. ...the few financial metrics to track: cash-burn rate, number of months’ worth of cash left... Rule No. 8:\n\nStartup Metrics Differ from Those in Existing Companies\n\nWe now have several centuries’ worth of performance metrics for existing businesses—P&Ls balance sheets, cash-flow forecasts and line-of-business analyses, plus scores of others. Here’s hoping your startup becomes big enough to need them someday. In the past (not so long ago), we used these\n\ntools with startups because we didn’t know what else to measure. We now know that startup metrics should focus on tracking the startup’s progress converting guesses and hypotheses into incontrovertible facts rather than measuring the execution of a static plan. It’s critical that board and management continuously test and measure each hypothesis until the entire business model is worth scaling into a company. If the company is venture-backed, management and investors must agree on a set of metrics that truly matter and work toward a report or “dashboard” that essentially replaces the P&L, cash flow, and balance sheet as centerpieces of early board meetings. Startup metrics track the results of pass/fail tests and the iterations they lead to:\n\nHave the customer problem and product features been validated? Does the minimum feature set resonate with customers? Who in fact is the customer, and have initial customer-related hypotheses on the likes of value proposition, customer segments, and channels been validated through face-to-face customer interaction? Customer-validation questions might include: average order size, customer lifetime value, average time to first order, rate of sales pipeline growth, improvement in close rate, and revenue per salesperson. In addition to the startup metrics above, the relatively few financial metrics that a startup board should be tracking are cash-burn rate, number of months’ worth of cash left, short-term hiring plans, and amount of time until the company reaches cash-flow break-even. Make sure decisions are fact-based, not faith-based."

        "Rule No. 9:\n\nFast Decision-Making, Cycle Time, Speed and Tempo\n\nSpeed matters at startups where the only absolute certainty is that the bank balance declines every day. While Rule No. 4 addresses iterations and pivots, it doesn’t specify how long they should take. Unequivocally, the faster the better, since the faster these “learn, build, pivot” or “iterate, build” cycles happen, the greater the odds of finding a scalable business model with the cash on hand. If cycles happen too slowly, the startup runs out of cash and dies. The biggest impediment to cycle time is psychological: it requires the admission of being wrong or even of suffering a short-term tactical defeat. While pivots and iterations are about speed outside the building, speed also matters inside the company. Most startup decisions are made in the face of uncertainty. There’s seldom a clear-cut, perfect solution to any engineering, customer or competitor problem, and founders shouldn’t agonize over trying to find one. This doesn’t mean gambling with the company’s fortunes on a whim. It means adopting plans with an acceptable degree of risk and doing so quickly. (Make sure these decisions are fact- based, not faith-based.) In general, the company that consistently makes and implements decisions rapidly gains a tremendous, often-decisive competitive advantage. ...startups should make reversible decisions before anyone leaves the CEO’s office. Startup decisions have two states: reversible and irreversible. A reversible decision could be adding or dropping a product feature or a new algorithm in the code or targeting a specific set of customers. If the decision proves a bad one, it can be unwound in a reasonable period of time. An irreversible decision such as firing an employee, launching a product, or signing a long lease on expensive office space is usually difficult or impossible to reverse. Startups should as policy, make reversible decisions before anyone leaves the CEO’s office or before a meeting ends. Perfect decision-making is both unimportant and impossible, and what matters more is forward momentum and a tight, fact-based feedback loop to quickly recognize and reverse bad decisions. By the time a big company gets the committee to get the subcommittee to pick a meeting date, most startups have made 20 decisions, reversed five, and implemented the other 15. Learning to make decisions quickly is just part of the equation. Agile startups have mastered another trick: tempo—the ability to make quick decisions consistently and at all levels in the company. Speed and tempo are integral parts of startup DNA, and a great startup’s tempo is often 10 times that of a large company. Rule No."

They’re terrific at executing fixed tasks, and it’s a wonderful life for almost everyone. The people leading almost every successful startup in history are just different. They’re a very tiny percentage of the world population, and their brains are wired for chaos, uncertainty, and blinding speed. They’re irrationally focused on customer needs and delivering great products. Their job is their life. It’s not 9-to-5, it’s 24/7. These are the people who found high-growth, highly-successful scalable startups. Startups demand execs who are comfortable with uncertainty, chaos and change. Rule No. 11:\n\nStartup Job Titles Are Very Different from a Large Company’s\n\nIn an existing company, job titles reflect the way tasks are organized to\n\nexecute a known business model. For example, the “Sales” title in an existing company means there’s a sales team repeatedly selling a known product to a well-understood group of customers, using a standard corporate presentation with an existing price list and standard terms, conditions and contract. The “Sales” title in an existing company is all about execution around a series of knowns. Compared with big companies, startups need executives whose skills are 180 degrees different. Startups demand execs who are comfortable with uncertainty, chaos and change—with presentations and offers changing daily, with the product changing often, with probing and gaining insights from failure rather than high-fiving a success. In short, they need the rare breed:\n\nopen to learning and discovery—highly curious, inquisitive, and creative\n\neager to search for a repeatable and scalable business model\n\nagile enough to deal with daily change and operating “without a map”\n\nreadily able to wear multiple hats, often on the same day\n\ncomfortable celebrating failure when it leads to learning and iteration\n\nWe suggest replacing traditional execution-oriented sales, marketing and business development titles with a single title: the Customer Development team. At first, this “team” will consist of the company’s founder(s), who talks with customers to gain enough insights to develop the minimum viable product. Later, as the startup moves into customer validation, the team may grow to include a dedicated “sales closer” responsible for the logistics of getting early orders signed. The closer shouldn’t be confused with a traditional sales VP. To succeed in this process, the team must have:\n\nthe ability to listen to customer objections and understand whether they are issues about the product, the presentation, the pricing or something else (or the wrong type of customer)\n\nexperience in talking to and moving between customers and engineers\n\nconfidence amid a state of constant change, often operating “without a map”\n\nthe ability to walk in their customers’ shoes, understanding how they work and the problems they face\n\nSome would say this checklist isn’t bad for identifying great entrepreneurs.

        "12:\n\nPreserve All Cash Until Needed. Then Spend. The goal of Customer Development is not to avoid spending money but to preserve cash while searching for the repeatable and scalable business model. Once found, then spend like there’s no tomorrow. This paragraph is worth deconstructing:\n\nPreserve cash: When a startup has unlimited cash (Internet bubbles, frothy venture climate), it can iterate on its mistakes by burning more dollars. When money is tight, without dollars to redo mistakes, it’s crucial to minimize waste. The Customer Development process preserves cash by not hiring any sales and marketing staff until the founders turn hypotheses into facts and discover a viable product/market fit. While searching: Customer Development observes that at the start, the company and its business model are based solely on hypotheses, not facts, and that the founders need to get out of the building to turn these hypotheses into customer data. This “get out of the building” approach, combined with rapid iteration and pivots, is central to the model’s customer discovery and validation steps. ...preserve cash while searching for the repeatable and scalable business model... Repeatable: Startups may get orders that stem from board members’ customer relationships, engineering one-offs, or heroic single-shot efforts by the CEO. These are great, but they aren’t repeatable by a sales organization. Search not for the one-off revenue hits but rather for a pattern that can be replicated by a sales organization selling off a price list or by customers regularly visiting the website. Scalable: The goal is not to get one customer but many—and for each additional customer to add incremental revenue and profit. The test is: Does the addition of one more salesperson or more marketing dollars bring in more gross profit (or users or clicks) than you invested? Who influences a sale?"

        "Who’s the customer? Spend like there’s no tomorrow: The goal of an investor-backed startup is not to build a lifestyle business. The goal is to reach venture scale (10 times the return on investment or more). When management and board agree that they’ve found a repeatable and scalable sales model (i.e., have a product/market fit), then invest the dollars to create end-user demand and drive those customers into the sales channel. Rule No. 13:\n\nCommunicate and Share Learning\n\nAn integral part of Customer Development’s “learning and discovery” philosophy is sharing everything that’s learned outside the building with employees, co-founders and even investors. The traditional way to do this is via weekly company meetings to keep employees informed and board meetings to let the investors understand the progress made in the search for the business model. But technology in the 21st-century has taken us to places we never could get to before. We can now\n\ncommunicate all we’re learning in near-real time to everyone who needs to know. We strongly recommend that the founders keep and share all their activities in the customer discovery step via a blog, CRM or product management tool. Think of it as a narrative of the customer discovery process. It records hypotheses the startup started with, who the team has talked to, the questions asked, the tests conducted, what’s been learned, and questions for advisors or investors. While this may seem burdensome, it takes less time than having a weekly coffee with an advisory board member. What results is a communications tool allowing outsiders to view the company’s progress up close and to offer suggestions and course corrections."

        "Rule No. 14:\n\nCustomer Development Success Begins With Buy- In\n\nCustomer Development’s “learning and discovery” philosophy can be immensely disorienting to a founder, engineer or investor who has spent his or her career executing a plan. For Customer Development to succeed, everyone on the team—from investor or parent company to engineers, marketeers and founders—needs to understand and agree that the Customer Development process is different to its core. If the engineering VP is talking waterfall development or the board demands a rigid timetable, Customer Development is destined for disaster. Everyone must accept the process, recognizing that this is a fluid, nonlinear search for a business model that can sometimes last for years. The Customer Development process is different to its core. Customer Development changes almost every aspect of startup behavior, performance, metrics, and, as often as not, success potential. It’s not just a “nice to do” while executing the revenue model in the back of the business plan. Customer Development reinvents the business model on the fly,\n\niterating often and pivoting whenever indicated. Founders need to have the commitment of the team and board before embarking on Customer Development. Ensure that all understand and agree that it’s iterative, necessary, and worthwhile and that it changes the benchmarks and metrics along the way. Comments such as “The product is already spec’ed, and we can’t change the features since development is already underway,” or “We already have the factory (or sales team or marketing materials) built,” or “We have to launch to make the numbers in the plan,” are all red flags. To succeed at Customer Development, the company must abandon the old model’s emphasis on execution of a fantasy business plan. Instead it must commit to a Customer Development process stressing learning, discovery, failure, and iteration in the search for a successful business model. If you’re ready for this process, this book will tell you how to do it. Summary: The Customer Development Process\n\nThe Customer Development process reflects the best practices of winning startups. It is the only approach for web-based businesses where failure is certain without constant customer feedback and product iteration as they search for their audiences. Customer Development’s fast cycle times and inherent cash conservation gives all entrepreneurs more chances to pivot, iterate, and succeed before the bank account runs dry. Describe this model to entrepreneurs who have taken companies all the way to a lucrative exit and beyond, and heads nod in recognition. While each step has its own specific objectives, the process as a whole has one overarching goal: discovering the repeatable, scalable, and ultimately profitable business before running out of cash. This transforms the company from a set of founding hypotheses into a moneymaking endeavor. Customer Development is damn hard work. You can’t fake it. Customer Development is damn hard work. You can’t fake it. You can’t just do the slides or “do” the process in a weekend. It’s a full-time, full-body- contact sport."

Overview of the Customer Discovery Process\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nAn Introduction to Customer Discovery\n\nNo startup business plan survives first contact with customers. —Steve Blank\n\nA journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. —Lao Tzu\n\nIRIDIUM WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST STARTUP gambles ever made—a bold and audacious $5.2 billion bet. Founded by Motorola and a global partnership of 18 companies in 1991, Iridium planned to build a mobile telephone system that would work “anywhere on Earth,” from ships in the middle of the ocean to the jungles of Africa to remote mountain peaks where no cell towers existed. How?"

        "With an out-of-this-world business plan. First, the company bought a fleet of 15 rockets from Russia, the U.S. and China. Next, it launched an armada of 72 private satellites into orbit, where they acted like 500-mile-high cell towers providing phone coverage to any spot on Earth. Seven years after Iridium’s founding, its satellites were in place. But nine months after the first call was made in 1998, the company was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. When Iridium crashed back to Earth, it ranked as one of the largest startup failures on record. What went wrong? When Iridium was founded in 1991, worldwide cell-phone coverage was sparse, unreliable and expensive. Cell-phone handsets were the size of lunch boxes. Iridium put together a business plan that made assumptions about customers, their problems and the product needed to solve those problems. Other assumptions about sales channel, partnerships, and revenue model all added up to a set of financial forecasts that Iridium would soon be printing money. One of the largest startup failures on record as they executed their business plan. But in the seven-plus years it took Iridium to go from concept to launch, innovation in mobile- and cell-phone networks moved at blinding speed. By the time Iridium launched, there were far fewer places on the planet where cell-phone service was unavailable. Traditional cell-phone companies provided coverage in the most valuable parts of the world. Prices for cell service shrunk as fast as phone handsets did. In contrast, Iridium’s satellite phone was bigger than a brick and weighed about as much. Worse, Iridium’s cell phone couldn’t make calls from cars or buildings, since it required line- of-sight “connection” to the satellites. Instead of 50 cents per minute for a regular cell call, Iridium’s calls cost $7 a minute, plus $3,000 for the handset itself. Iridium’s potential market shrunk nearly every day. Instead of a massive worldwide market of potential users, it had drawn only a small group willing to pay its prices and put up with the product’s many limitations. But Iridium’s business model assumptions and plans were firmly fixed as if it was still 1991. The company spent $5 billion building a business over eight years without ever focusing on four key questions:\n\nHave we identified a problem a customer wants to see solved? Does our product solve this customer problem or need? If so, do we have a viable and profitable business model? Have we learned enough to go out and sell? Answering these questions is the purpose of the first step in the\n\ncustomer discovery process. This chapter explains how to go about it. (Twenty years later, Iridium emerged from bankruptcy. In 2000, an investor group bought $6 billion worth of its assets for $25 million."

        "This critical task can’t be assigned to junior staffers and must be driven by founders. Only after the founders have performed this step will they know whether they have a valid vision or just a hallucination. Sounds simple, doesn’t it? But for anyone who has worked in established companies, the customer discovery process is disorienting. All the rules about new-product management in large companies are turned upside down. It’s instructive to enumerate all things you are not going to do:\n\nunderstand the needs and wants of all customers\n\nmake a list of all the features customers want before they buy your product\n\nhand Product Development a features list of the sum of all customer requests\n\nhand Product Development a detailed marketing-requirements document\n\nrun focus groups and test customers’ reactions to your product to see if they will buy\n\nWhat you are going to do is develop your product for the few, not the many. Moreover, you’re going to start building your product even before you know whether you have any customers for it. On a startups first day, there’s limited—if any— customer input. For an experienced marketing or product management executive, these ideas are not only disorienting and counterintuitive but heretical. Why aren’t the needs of all potential customers important? What is it about a first product from a new company that’s different from follow-on products in a large company? What is it about a startup’s first customers that make the rules so different? Search for the Problem/Solution Fit\n\nThe customer discovery process searches for problem/solution fit: “have we found a problem lots of people want us to solve (or a need they want us to fill)” and “does our solution (a product, a website, or an app) solve the problem in a compelling way?” At its core, the essence of customer discovery is to determine whether your startup’s value proposition matches the customer segment it plans to target. Problem/solution fit is virtually identical to what’s sometimes called “product/ market fit,” as the previous paragraph indicates. As a result, we use the terms somewhat interchangeably throughout the book. Do realize, however, that in multi-sided markets, there may be multiple value propositions and multiple customer segments. But problem/solution fit is only achieved when the revenue model, pricing, and customer acquisition efforts all match up with the customers’ needs. Develop the Product for the Few, Not the Many\n\nIn existing companies, the goal of traditional product management and marketing is to develop a market-requirements document (MRD) for engineering that contains the sum of all possible customer feature requests, prioritized in a collaborative effort among Product Management, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering. Marketing or Product Management hosts focus groups, analyzes sales data from the field, and looks at customer feature requests and complaints. This information leads to the adding of requested\n\nfeatures to the product specification, and the engineering team builds them into the next product release. While this process is rational for an established company entering an existing market, it’s folly for startups. Why? Startups aren’t small versions of large, existing companies where there’s plenty of customer knowledge and input. In established companies, the MRD process ensures that engineering will build a product that appeals to existing customers in a known market, where customers and their needs are known. On a startup’s first day, there’s limited—if any—customer input for creating a formal product specification. In a startup, the first product is not designed to satisfy a mainstream customer. No startup can afford to build a product with every feature a mainstream customer needs all at once. The product would take years to get to market and be obsolete by the time it arrived. Instead, successful startups solve this conundrum by focusing development and early selling efforts on a very small group of early customers who have bought into the startup’s vision. These visionary customers will give the company the feedback necessary to add features to the product over time. Earlyvangelists are willing to make a leap of faith and buy an early product. Earlyvangelists: The Most Important Customers of All\n\nEnthusiasts who spread the good news about your product to friends, family or co-workers are often called evangelists. But a new word is needed to describe the early adopters—the visionary customers—who buy unfinished and untested products, because they want to “first,” whether it’s for the sake of gaining a competitive edge or winning bragging rights. We call these early adopters earlyvangelists. Unlike “mainstream” business or consumer-product customers who want to buy a finished, completed, tested product, earlyvangelists are willing to make a leap of faith and buy an early product from a startup. Every industry has a small subset of visionaries willing to take a leap of faith on an early product. One of the mistakes that startup founders make is to give away or heavily discount early alpha/beta products to blue-chip customers. In single- sided markets (where the user is the payer) earlyvangelists will be happy to pay for early access to the product. If they won’t, they aren’t earlyvangelists. Their willingness to pay is a critical part of the customer discovery process. You’ll use it to test the entire buying process. Earlyvangelist Characteristics (Figure 4.1)\n\nIn web/mobile apps, where multi-sided markets (separate users and payers) are often found, earlyvangelists can be users or payers. But even as nonpaying users, these earlyvangelists are willing or eager accelerators of your viral growth. Earlyvangelists are willing or eager accelerators of your viral growth. In both physical and web/mobile channels, earlyvangelists display these\n\ncommon characteristics (see Figure 4.1):\n\nThey have a problem or need. They understand they have a problem."

        "They’re actively searching for a solution and have a timetable for finding it. The problem is so painful that they’ve cobbled together an interim solution. They’ve committed, or can quickly acquire, budget dollars to purchase. Think of earlyvangelists’ characteristics along a scale of customer pain. Earlyvangelist customers will be found only at the top of the scale—those who have already been looking for a solution, built a home-grown solution (whether in a company by building a software solution or at home by taping together a fork, a light bulb and a vacuum cleaner) and have or can acquire a budget. These people are perfect earlyvangelist candidates. They can be relied on for feedback and initial sales; they’ll tell others about the product and spread the word that the vision is real. Moreover, they can be potential advisory board candidates. Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) First\n\nThe idea that a startup builds its product for a small group of initial customers\n\nrather than devising a generic mainstream spec is radical. What follows is equally revolutionary. The goal of the MVP is to build the smallest possible feature set. On the day the company starts, there is very limited customer input. All the startup has is a vision of what the problem, product and solution seem to be. Unfortunately, it’s either a vision or a hallucination. The company doesn’t know who its initial customers are or what features they’ll want. One option is to start developing an entire full-featured first release of the product, with every feature the founders can think of. We now know this results in wasted engineering effort, time and cash, as customers don’t use, want or need most of the features developed without their input. Another path is to put Product Development on hold until the Customer Development team can find customers who can provide adequate feedback. The risk here is lost time and no product for customers to provide feedback against. A third, more productive approach is to develop the core features of the product (incrementally and iteratively with agile engineering methods), with the feature list driven by the vision and experience of the company’s founders. This is a minimum viable product. The goal of customer discovery is to test your understanding of the customer’s problem and see if your proposed solution will prompt him to use or buy the product based on its most important features alone. Most users want finished products, but earlyvangelists are the perfect target for the MVP. Tailor the initial product release to satisfy their needs. If no one thinks your MVP solution is interesting or sufficient, iterate or pivot until an adequate number say “yes.”\n\nThe shift in thinking to an incremental and iterative MVP as opposed to a fully featured first product release is important. Engineers tend to make a product bigger and more perfect. The MVP helps them focus the most important and indispensable features. Your goal in having an MVP is not to gather feature requests to change the product or to make the feature set larger. Instead, the goal is to put the MVP in front of customers to find out whether you understood the customer problem well enough to define key elements of the solution. Then you iteratively refine the solution. If, and only if, no\n\ncustomers can be found for the most important features of the MVP, bring customers’ additional feature requests to the product development team. In the Customer Development model, feature requests to an MVP are by exception and iteration rather than by rule. This eliminates the endless list of feature requests that often delay first customer ship and drive product development teams crazy. MVPs for Web/Mobile Are Different\n\nWeb/mobile businesses conduct customer discovery differently from those in the physical channel. They can reach hundreds or thousands more customers by combining online and face-to-face interactions. They place a greater emphasis on customer acquisition, activation, and referrals. Web/mobile minimum viable products can be developed faster and delivered earlier, accelerating the discovery process. When delivered, they can conduct more tests with customers, with more granular customer-response data. This results in a faster iteration of the problem statement, the proposed solution, and the MVP itself. Use the Business Model Canvas as The Customer Discovery Scorecard\n\nOften there’s a lack of a shared and clear understanding of the business model throughout the company. This customer discovery step uses Alexander Osterwalder’s business model canvas to diagrammatically illustrate how a company intends to make money. As shown in Figure 4.2 the canvas represents any company in nine boxes, depicting the details of a company’s product, customers, channels, demand creation, revenue models, partners, resources, activities and cost structure. (We described the business model canvas in detail in the Customer Development Manifesto.)\n\nBusiness Model Canvas (Figure 4.2)\n\nIn this phase you’ll develop a one- or two-page brief about each of the\n\nfollowing boxes in the business model canvas:\n\nMarket Size: how big the opportunity is\n\nValue Proposition, Part 1: the product/service, its benefits and minimum viable product\n\nCustomer Segments: who the customer is and what problems the product solves\n\nChannels: how the product will be distributed and sold\n\nCustomer Relationships: how demand will be created\n\nValue Proposition, Part 2: market-type hypothesis and competitive set/ differentiation\n\nKey Resources: suppliers, commodities, or other essential elements of the business\n\nKey Partners: other enterprises essential to success of the business\n\nRevenue Streams: revenue and profit sources and size\n\nWhen you first draft your initial hypotheses your canvas begins to fill\n\nup, looking like Figure 4.3. Sample Business Model Canvas—Initial Hypotheses (Figure 4.3)\n\nBut in addition to using the business model canvas as a static snapshot\n\nof the business at a single moment, frozen in time, Customer Development uses the canvas as a “scorecard” to track progress in searching for a business model. Once a week update the canvas to reflect any pivots or iterations,\n\nhighlighting in red the changes from the last week. Then after you and your team agree on the changes to your business model, integrate them into what becomes your new canvas for the week (the accepted changes in red are then shown in black). During the next week any new changes are again shown in red. Then the process repeats each week – new changes showing up in red. Then a new canvas used for the week. This method highlights the changes over time for your and the team’s\n\nreference. Figure 4.4 shows how the canvases will look over time. Using the Business Model Canvas as a Weekly Scorecard (Figure 4.4)\n\nHad they read this book, and gotten out of the building, the folks at Iridium might have saved billions by learning just how small the market for their business had become. It would have allowed them to search for alternatives and survival. there’s To sum up the customer discovery philosophy: whether product/market fit by finding earlyvangelists, understanding their needs, and verifying that the initial minimum viable product solves a problem they’ll eagerly pay to have solved. And if not, use near-continuous customer feedback to drive agile, frequent changes in product and business model alike. As you complete the hypothesis development, your business model canvas quickly becomes multi-dimensional. You are really developing three initial canvases:\n\nCore elements of the business model itself (value proposition, channel, etc.)\n\nHypotheses you have for each element of the business model (such as “people will want these features, “or “customers will buy our product because...”)\n\nAnd a layer outlining the key pass/fail tests you will use to get face-to- face with customers and use their feedback to convert your hypotheses into facts. Overview of Customer Discovery\n\nCustomer Discovery: Overview of the Process (Figure 4.5)\n\nCustomer Discovery has Four Phases\n\nPhase 1 deconstructs the founders’ vision into the nine parts of the business model canvas (product, customers, channels, demand creation, revenue models, partners, resources, activities and cost structure). Then your team writes one-page briefs about each of the hypotheses, including the list of experiments or tests you’ll need to conduct to prove or disprove each one."

    [
        "In Phase 2 you conduct experiments to test your “problem” hypotheses. This helps you understand how important the problem is and how big it can become. You do so by testing most elements of the business model, including the value proposition, pricing, channel strategy, and sales process. Your goal is to turn hypotheses into facts or discard them if they’re wrong, and replace them with new hypotheses. In the process, you’ll gain a deep understanding of customers’ business, workflow, organization, and product needs."

        "When all the facts are in, update your results on the canvas. Web-based products and channels often implement much of Phase 2\n\nonline in near-real time. In Phase 3, you test your “solution,” presenting your value proposition (product, pricing, features, and other business model components) and the minimum viable product to customers and compare their responses to the “pass/fail” goals you developed earlier. For a web-based product, the MVP is a live site, a live demo, or a feature or piece of functionality or content. The goal is not to sell the product, but to validate how well you understood the problem in Phase 2 when you heard customers say, “Even these minimum features solve our problems,” or, “I need this product.” Ideally, customers ask, “When can I get it?”\n\nOnline, customers should engage and interact, spend time on it or with it, appear in droves, come back again and again, and bring their friends. In Phase 4 you stop and assess the results of the experiments you’ve conducted and verify that you have:\n\na full understanding of customers’ problems, passions, or needs\n\nconfirmed the value proposition solves problems, passions or needs\n\ndetermined that a sizable volume of customers exists for the product\n\nlearned what customers will pay for the product\n\nmade certain the resulting revenue should deliver a profitable business\n\nWith your product features and business model validated, decide whether you have learned enough to go out and try to sell a select your product to a few visionary customers, or whether you need to go back to customers to learn some more. If, and only if, you are successful in this step do you proceed to customer validation. That’s customer discovery in a nutshell.

The company’s later success was due to the four passionate entrepreneurs’ willingness to listen to customers and to the three painful pivots driven by customer feedback. The Browser Breakthrough\n\nDuring the ’90s, large corporations acquired different software applications to automate each part of their enterprise—finance, customer support, manufacturing, and sales among them. But the data these applications collected were accessed via reporting tools from the IT organization. More important, the data existed in “virtual silos,” with each functional system walled off from the other. The finance system didn’t talk to the sales system, which didn’t know that the manufacturing system even existed. Queries like “Compare the sales data of green dresses versus blue ones with current inventory for each by store, and contrast the gross margin by region to calculate discounts” were virtually impossible to answer to because they\n\nrequired combining data from three incompatible applications.

She introduced the company to five other database marketing executives, who essentially said, “If you get a system working at Schwab, we’ll have to buy one as well.” You couldn’t get much better its first earlyvangelist and first market. than\n\nthat. E.piphany had found\n\nBut each time Schwab’s people looked at the system’s technical details, they politely said our product was missing a key feature for database marketing. It took two meetings before the founders realized they understood her problem, all right, but the solution—the underlying database schema of the software—was missing the most important feature for solving it. It didn’t include “householding,” and without this feature, she could never buy the E.piphany system. (Householding, well-known among database marketers, recognizes that two or more people at the same physical address live together and, in Schwab’s case, often invest together. This feature was crucial to direct-marketers who didn’t want to send multiple or differing ads to the same address.) And no amount of sales and marketing hand-waving was going to fix the problem. It was a major mistake."
    ],
    [
        "Until this meeting, the founders hadn’t understood the customer problem well enough to provide the correct solution. E.piphany’s co-founders, Ben Wegbreit and Steve Blank, joined the Schwab VP, and her engineering team in a deep technical discussion of what the software needed to do for Schwab’s business and what was needed. Ben asked five or 10 questions, everybody nodded and the meeting ended. On the long ride back to E.piphany’s living-room office, Steve asked, “Ben, how do\n\nwe solve Schwab’s problem?”\n\nAfter a moment of silence, he replied, “Show them page 6 of our\n\nproduct spec.”\n\n“What do you mean page 6? Our spec only has five pages!” Ben looked at Steve and smiled. “Not anymore.” They had just pivoted the product and refined the minimum feature set. E.piphany’s first order from Schwab came the week after they demo’ed householding. Other orders followed soon after. A week later, the founders sat down to figure out what other feature they would toss out to make room for this one. E.piphany would go through two additional equally painful pivots before its initial public offering, but that “householding” pivot sold the founders on the “power of the pivot” value. The meeting and car ride from Schwab to the company headquarters illustrates the customer validation process every startup needs: a method for validating the business model with real customers and orders. Customer validation turns hypotheses into facts about basic questions\n\nlike: • Do we understand the sales/user acquisition process? Is it repeatable?"
    ],
    [
        "Can we prove it’s repeatable? (If our business model is single-sided commerce, the only acceptable proof is enough full-price orders.)\n\nCan we get these orders/users with the current product? Have we tested sales and distribution channels? • Are we confident we can scale orders/users into a profitable business? • Have we correctly positioned the product and the company? The Customer Validation Philosophy\n\nCustomer validation attempts to “test sell” at every stage. It runs a continuing series of quantitative pass/fail tests to determine whether there’s strong enough product/market fit to justify scaling sales and marketing spending. Most of your testing effort will be asking people to give you an order or engage with your app or website. At this point, you’re testing the entire business model, not its individual components, even as you learn more details about some, like price or channel. Just as customer discovery was disorienting for experienced marketers,\n\nthe customer validation process turns the world upside down for experienced salespeople and, in particular, those with sales responsibility. All the rules sales executives learned while selling in physical channels at large companies are not applicable to startups. In fact, they’re positively detrimental. It’s not all about the launch party! In the customer validation step, you are not going to hire and staff a sales team. You are not going to execute to a sales plan or “the sales strategy.” The reality is that you don’t know enough yet to do any of these things. At the end of customer discovery, you have in hand firm hypotheses about who will buy, why they will buy, and at what price they will buy. But until those hypotheses are validated—with customer orders—they’re all little more than educated guesses, even with the work invested to develop them. From Business Model Canvas to the Sales Roadmap\n\nIn customer discovery you tested some of the hypotheses of your business model:\n\nValue proposition: You affirmed it with a few dozen to a few hundred people\n\nCustomer segments: You have a hypothesis about customer archetypes\n\nCustomer relationships: You tested several “get, keep and grow” activities\n\nChannel: You understand your key channel partners, and some have expressed interest\n\nRevenue model: The company has an idea of how to price its offering\n\nA sales roadmap uses all you’ve learned from customer discovery to guide the creation of a sales funnel specifically for your company. It answers:\n\nWho influences a sale?"
    ],
    [
        "Who recommends a sale? Who is the decision-maker? Who is the economic buyer? The saboteur? Where is the budget for purchasing the type of product you’re selling? How many sales calls are needed to make one sale? How long does an average sale take from beginning to end? What is the selling strategy? Is this a solution sale? If so, what are “key customer problems?”\n\nWhat’s the profile of optimal visionary buyers, the earlyvangelists every startup needs? Where will the traffic come from?"
    ],
    [
        "Will it stick? Will the product be strong enough to grow virally? Unless a company has proven answers to these questions, few sales will happen, and those that do occur will result from heroic single-shot efforts. Of course, on some level, most sales VPs realize they lack the knowledge they need to draw a detailed sales roadmap, but most believe they and their newly hired sales team can acquire this information while simultaneously selling and closing orders. This is because most executives new to startups confuse searching for a business model with the execution of a known business model. A sales roadmap is part of the search for a business model. Only after it’s built can it be executed. Startups can’t learn and discover while they’re busy executing. As we can see from the rubble of any number of failed startups, attempting to execute before you have a sales roadmap in place is pure folly. Building a Sales Roadmap Versus Building a Sales Force\n\nGiven how critical the validation step is, a CEO’s first instinct is to speed up the process by spending more on customer acquisition or adding salespeople. The reality is, this doesn’t speed up the validation phase. In fact, it most often slows it down. Instead, you’ll build a roadmap to figure out how to get repeatable sales (by explicitly testing product/ market fit). Once that’s done, then build a sales organization. Developing a sales roadmap is part of the search for a business model. In an existing market, customer validation may simply validate that the sales VP’s rolodex or contact list is relevant, and that product performance metrics the company identified in customer discovery were correct. In a re- segmented, clone or new market, even a rolodex of infinite size (or tripling the AdWords budget) won’t substitute for a proven business model and a tested sales roadmap. For an experienced sales or business development executive, these statements about customer validation are heretical. All the actions in Customer Development we consider to be mistakes are what traditional sales professionals have been trained to do. It seems counterintuitive and disorienting. So let’s look more closely at why the first sales in a startup are so different from later-stage sales or selling in a large company. Founders Must Lead the Customer Validation Team\n\nFounders who complete customer discovery often mistakenly ease up and delegate customer validation activities to Sales, Business Development, Marketing or Product Management. This is a bad idea. Middle and junior managers aren’t likely to be good at customer validation, which requires creative searching, probing, and turning on a dime—not execution of a repeatable process. Why must the founders lead? First, founders and only founders call the shots on pivoting. To do so, they must hear about flaws in the product or business model directly from the customers. Nothing else has the same impact. Anyone other than a founder who learns of a serious product or business-plan flaw faces two challenges: he or she doesn’t have the authority to pivot, and he or she seldom has the courage to report bad customer feedback to the founder. In web/mobile channels, where there’s much more feedback to process, the founders still make the call about pivots, but the company needs to have data junkies, A/B testers, statisticians, and SEO/PPC experts, as well as at least one or two wildly creative online marketers. (This might be physically embodied in the founder and one or two amazing people.) This team will measure, assess, manage and improve the acquisition, or Get Customers, funnel. As they’re getting “out of the building” digitally, a\n\ncustomer development team also leaves physically for face-to-face customer validation, and for deal-making that drives traffic or referrals. Validation Proceeds at Different Speeds in Different Channels\n\nIt takes far more time to set up visits in a physical channel with prospects in cellphone companies in Asia and Africa than to get customer feedback electronically for a website. And more customers can be reached via web/mobile channels than can ever be met face-to-face. Customer validation for web/mobile startups always proceeds faster with many more iterations than it does with physical channels and goods. Why? It’s all bits that can be changed. Regardless of speed, the fundamental principles of customer validation are identical across all channels. Make Early Sales to Earlyvangelists\n\nIn customer validation you will target Earlyvangelists as your first paying customers. (If you can’t sell to them, it doesn’t get better over time.)\n\nConstrain Spending in Customer Validation\n\nA typical failure scenario for startups is premature scaling, when there are more salespeople in the field burning cash than are needed while your business model is still unproven. Or running expensive demand-creation activities before you’re sure who your customers really are. Too often those sales people are fired and their marketing programs killed when the startup faces a major pivot after scaling too early. Customer validation delays sales- and-marketing hiring and spending until validation is nearly complete. This constraint is central to the process, which assumes startups will fail and iterate often. The spending constraint keeps enough cash in the bank to fund multiple pivots on the road to success. Prioritize What Needs to be Validated\n\nPrioritizing the business model elements that need validating is essential at the start of customer validation. Every startup business model has a zillion moving parts. Validation can’t possibly measure and affirm every variable or the founders will be 100 years old by the time they’re ready to scale—or, worse, exit—the business. The business model canvas is an excellent guide here. Most startups will focus on the four core elements: value proposition, customer relationships, channel, and revenue model. This list works for many businesses but not all. Multi-sided markets need to prioritize all sides of the market. Think about the five or fewer things that will make this a huge, successful business—or not. Why Accountants Don’t Run Startups\n\nWith all the process steps involved, it’s sometimes hard to remember that the Customer Development process isn’t a giant focus group. The goal is not to add up all the customer feedback and vote on what features to implement. Founders who are artists at heart run startups—the true purpose of Customer Development is to inform their vision. (In a new market, there’s no data at all!) A great entrepreneur may consider all the customer data, listen to his instincts and say, “Here’s why I’m going to ignore what we just heard.”\n\nAnd Finally: Don’t Be Afraid to Let Go When\n\nLightning Strikes\n\nOccasionally, fast-scaling web/mobile startups with viral or network-effect drivers find the business suddenly blasting off, even if this book doesn’t suggest that it should happen yet. This occurred at Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, to name an elite few. If you’re lucky enough to hit a consumer nerve as hard as they did, put this book down and hold on to the rocket ship."

        "After all, that’s what entrepreneurs do! (Skim the book another time on your private jet or yacht or Sunfish.)\n\nThe Customer Validation Philosophy, in Summary\n\nCustomer discovery first tested your hypotheses about the company’s\n\nbusiness model with a relatively tiny group of customers who were asked for opinions, not orders. Discovery itself didn’t deliver any proven, hard facts about who would buy or how scalable the business was. Customer validation goes to the next step and determines whether a product/market fit can be validated by orders or usage. It does so by further developing the MVP as well as the company’s sales and marketing plans and materials. Then it gets founders out of the building (physically, virtually, or both) to test the MVP and every other key business model hypotheses, including product features, pricing, channel, and positioning. How? By asking for orders (or downloads, logons, or clicks)! Test the MVP. How?"
    ],
    [
        "By asking for orders. Customer validation is complete when the company has answers to these\n\nthree questions:\n\n1. Can the business scale? Will a dollar spent on customer acquisition yield more than a dollar’s worth of incremental revenue, page views, downloads or clicks? 2. Is there a repeatable and scalable sales roadmap? Does the company know the right prospects to call on or acquire, and what to say to them to consistently deliver sales? 3. Is the sales funnel predictable? Do the same sales programs and tactics consistently deliver an adequate, profitable flow of customers through the funnel? Now let’s get started. Overview of the Customer Validation Process\n\nCustomer Validation: Overview of the Process (Figure 5.1)\n\nCustomer Validation has Four Phases\n\nPhase 1 consists of six “get ready to sell” activities; product positioning, sales/ marketing materials for “test selling” efforts, the hiring of a sales\n\ncloser, the creation of a distribution channel plan, refining a sales roadmap, and creating an advisory board. These activities make your team the best prepared early stage venture ever to hit the streets. Companies in web/mobile channels also have six “get ready to sell” activities: Product Positioning, assembling Acquire/Activate Plans, building the high-fidelity MVP, building the metrics toolset, hiring a “data chief” and creating an advisory board. They help deliver lean, cost-effective customer acquisition programs. Phase 2 gets founders out of the building to put the product to the ultimate test: will customers validate your business model by buying your product? You’ll attempt to actually sell customers an unfinished and unproven product without a professional sales organization. Getting feedback is as important as getting orders. Startups in the physical channel do this with brochures, PowerPoints, sales materials and, where possible, product demos or mockups. Dozens if not hundreds of meetings help refine the product presentation and channel plans, validate the sales roadmap, prove the predictability of the sales funnel, and validate that the business model is repeatable, scalable and profitable in a real-world test. Web/mobile startups “go live” and get out of the building virtually to see if their plans and tools to acquire customers actually attract customers who activate or buy. Do more than a handful of real customers behave as the hypotheses suggest they will? Acquisition and activation activities are measured and optimized. Startups in multi-sided markets (physical or web/mobile) need to get out of the building to test each side of the market. Web/Mobile marketers first test users and then validate a different set of hypotheses (value proposition, segment, revenue model, etc.) with the “payers,” who are marketers or advertisers willing to pay to reach people using the site for free. Phase 3 happens once you have a couple of orders under your belt and enough customer information to develop and refine your product and company positioning. The positioning is tested in meetings with industry pundits and analysts and face-to-face with the expanded customer audience. Web/mobile startups refine their “Get” program tactics. Then they conduct initial product positioning, next they gather and organize the customer behavior data collected in Phase 2: customer responses to “Get”\n\nactivities and metrics summarizing their initial on-site behavior. They collect feedback about the MVP itself and the effectiveness of acquisition tools. Phase 4 stops all activity for long enough to conduct a detailed pivot-or- proceed analysis and verify that, regardless of channel, customer validation is complete and the company knows how to scale. If so, it’s ready to reap the rewards for founders and investors alike."
    ],
    [
        "But first there are lots of tough questions and hard work to verify. In sum, the question is simple: “is this a business worth doing,” and devoting several years of backbreaking work? Will it generate enough revenue, growth and profits to achieve the founders’ and investors’ goals? And has the team learned enough to make it happen?"
    ],
    [
        "Odds are overwhelming that the optimum business model won’t be\n\nfound on the first or second try in validation. The moment customer validation is over is when it’s clear that there are real orders, users, or clicks—not surveys or chats. Customer validation confirms that customers will accept the minimum viable product, proves that the customers exist, figures out how to reach them predictably, and crafts a scalable plan to engage and sell many more. It’s often called the “epiphany moment.”\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nCustomer Validation: The Toughest Question of All: Pivot or Proceed? THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL, MOST GUT-WRENCHING phase of customer validation: honestly determining whether there’s a scalable, profitable business model ahead. Is the company ready to go forward to the customer creation step, when millions of dollars are often spent to fuel rapid customer growth? This step literally “calls the question” about the company’s future directions. It’s time to study all the test results, all the customer learning and all the insights you’ve had from the facts you’ve gathered. Its time to see if the company is ready to start spending money to scale, and that the result will be a great, profitable company. There are three steps to answering the crucial “pivot or proceed” question:\n\nAssemble and review all key discovery and validation findings\n\nReview the business model hypotheses and their interactions with one another\n\nFocus on the “metrics that matter” in the financial model\n\nPivot or Proceed: Assemble Data Findings\n\nBy this point, the team has assembled a massive amount of hard data:\n\nindustry research, customer segments, customer feedback, marketing program results, channel and cost input and much more. The data needs to be verified, with any gaps, discrepancies, or anomalies filled in along the way. A few examples:\n\nThe company needs 10,000 customers in order to be profitable, but the market isn’t that large\n\nCustomer acquisition or channel costs are too high, rendering the company unprofitable\n\nThe sales roadmap is too long and complex, making the cost of sales way too high\n\nDespite best efforts, referrals just aren’t delivering additional customers\n\nThese anomalies are relatively easy to spot when all the data is collected in one room. They often call for further customer, channel, or product development discussions."

Build a War Room\n\nThe best way to “translate” piles of data, reports and questionnaires is to make it as visual as possible. For best results, lock the founding team in a room for a day or two to walk step by step through each hypothesis. Cover one wall with a blown up “final” business model canvas. Cover the other wall with the hypotheses themselves, sorted to keep the pieces of each hypothesis together (remember, many hypotheses have multiple parts). Use another wall for supporting diagrams, and allow space for the most recent canvas and perhaps one or two earlier iterations. Leave a large whiteboard available for keeping score of questions and changes and for the key “metrics that matter” numbers that emerge (discussed in detail in Step 3). While not every diagram is appropriate for your startup, review:\n\na work-flow map of the prototypical customer that diagrams how customers do their jobs or live their lives both with and without the new product\n\nan organizational/influence map showing whom consumers or businesspeople interact with, how often, and how those people influence buying decisions. customer archetypes: how they earn and spend their money and use their time\n\na market map showing where your customers will come from\n\na channel or sales roadmap diagramming how sales will happen\n\na fully updated business model canvas (along with a few earlier versions)\n\nReview the Data\n\nThe most important hard data to review includes:\n\ncustomer feedback, particularly from sales report cards evaluating customer enthusiasm for the product and its potential sales revenue over time\n\nmarket size and market share estimates\n\nchannel feedback and revenue potential summaries\n\npricing, customer acquisition costs, and any major product cost changes\n\ndetailed information about the industry, the customers, and their behavior\n\ncompetitive product and pricing information\n\nresults of your web “get, keep and grow” tests\n\ndetails of your customer acquisition costs and viral coefficient and the latest stats on page views per visit, visit frequency, user growth, and\n\nretention optimization\n\nuser-testing results, showing the rate of improvement for activation, conversion, retention and growth activities\n\nThe team, often including investors, should review all the materials to ensure that all the learning from discovery and validation has been integrated into the latest versions of the hypothesis documents and into an updated version of the business model canvas that will be discussed in the next step. The key activity at this stage is to look at the intersections of, or interactions among, the business model components, since no doubt many components have changed along the way."

        "Keep them handy. And worry “Am I going to bet my company that I got them right?”\n\nPivot or Proceed: Validate Your Business Model\n\nIt’s been a long road but you’ve converted most of your business model hypotheses from customer discovery into facts. You’ve done so by extensive testing through face-to-face customer interactions. So, if the customer- relationships hypothesis said one of every five acquired customers will activate and pay for the service or app, this actually happened in validation, with hundreds if not thousands of customers. Or you’ve proven that people return to the product or app three times a week for an average of 20 minutes\n\nper visit or spend $100 a month visiting once. Review Business Model Hypotheses (Figure 6.1)\n\nThe team should assemble data collected in the last phase in its “war room” use the checklist to walk through the business model hypotheses, box by box, and ascertain that there are factual, definitive answers to at least every question on the checklist. In this final phase of customer validation the company asks itself the same questions it asked in Phase 4 of customer discovery. But at this point, it should have much more quantitative, irrefutable proof of the answers, since you’ve spoken to far more customers and conducted many more tests. Web/mobile startups have a unique set of business model hypotheses that they need to validate, particularly in the “Get/Keep/Grow” Customer Relationships area. These questions include:\n\nHas the company proven it can acquire and activate a steadily-increasing number of customers at a cost in line with the cost structure? Are the customers being acquired demonstrating that they will spend and “stick” with the company at rates that will deliver the revenue plan? And are customers referring other good quality customers in sufficient numbers to deliver these often-free new customers, reducing the average acquisition cost? In multi-sided markets, are customers visiting often enough, participating actively enough, and staying active long enough to help the company generate the revenues it needs to succeed? The Business Model Canvas as a Scorecard\n\nHopefully you’ve been taking regular snapshots of your business model canvas – either week-by-week snapshots, or at least at each major pivot. If you’ve done it this way you now essentially have a film strip of the entrepreneurial process. As you can see from Figure 6.1, each stage of discovery and validation refined the canvas. Experiments were run, learning caused iterations and a few pivots, and all were documented in a new canvas (reread here). Now that you have your canvases up on the wall use them as a point of\n\ndiscussion. The answers to “Is this a business?” can be found in the results of the multitude of tests you’ve conducted throughout the validation process. The answers to “Is this a business?” can be found in the results of the multitude of tests you’ve conducted throughout the validation process. As is often the case, when the results aren’t convincing enough, or when they don’t deliver the traffic or financial targets of the business model, it’s time to iterate or pivot, and retest to see if the new approach improves the results. After all, the company will very shortly be spending millions of dollars in the customer creation phase, where results are expected to be far more predictable, and much more is at risk. While this may seem ambitious and unreasonable, the closer a company is to this “fact-based plan,” the greater its chances for\n\nbusiness and fund-raising success.

        "Some elements of the business model represent revenue or costs, while others fuel growth. Physical and web/mobile channel costs vary widely, as do rates of sale and growth, so one last time we’ll examine the metrics three different ways:\n\nIn a physical channel, less than a dozen numbers usually tell the entire story:\n\nValue proposition: What are product cost, market size, attainable market share, and customer impact of network effects? Customer Relationships: What are customer acquisition costs, prospect conversion rates, customer lifetime value, and customer switching costs that the company may have to pay? Market Type: As discussed in Chapter 3, different market types drive different revenue curves to consider in longer-term revenue predictions\n\nCost Structure: What are the basic operating costs of the business? Channel: What are the costs of selling through the channel? Channel margin, promotion, shelf-space charges? Revenue Streams: What are the average selling price, total achievable revenue, and number of customers a year? Burn Rate (derived from the above): How much cash is the company “burning” (spending) a month? When will the company run out of cash? There’s no precise formula for what a burn rate should be, but since it’s the issue over which boards most often fire their founders, the founders and investors must agree on what the burn rate should be and how many\n\nmore pivots the startup can afford in its search for the scalable, profitable business model\n\nIn the web/mobile channel, less than a dozen numbers tell the entire\n\nstory:\n\nValue proposition: What is the estimated per-user cost of a user, and are there any incremental costs when one’s added. Estimate the market size, attainable market share, and the customer impact of referrals or network effects\n\nCustomer Relationships: What are customer acquisition costs, prospect conversion and retention rates, and how many new customers or users will your current customers get you virally, for free? Market Type: As discussed in Chapter 3, different market types drive different revenue curves to consider in longer-term revenue predictions\n\nCost Structure: What are the basic operating costs of the business? (Be sure not to mingle or double-count these costs with your value proposition costs)\n\nChannel: What are the costs of selling through the channel: payments to app stores, marketplace sites like Amazon.com, or related sites referring customers to you? Revenue Streams: What are the average selling price, total achievable revenue, and number of customers a year, and how long or how often will customers spend? Burn Rate (derived from the above): How much cash is the company “burning” (spending) a month? When will the company run out of cash? A Few Words about Burn Rate\n\nVenture capitalist Fred Wilson suggests some burn-rate guidelines for venture funded web/mobile businesses that may be helpful to entrepreneurs of all stripes. Wilson’s advice looks at burn rate based on the company’s growth stage. Customer discovery, which he calls the “building product” stage, should keep the burn rate between $50,000 and $75,000 a month, which should fund a team of three or four engineers building the MVP as well as the founding team, rent, operating costs and the like\n\nCustomer validation, Wilson’s “building usage” stage, shouldn’t exceed a burn rate of $100,000 a month. This stage begins when product/market fit is achieved and fuels the “get customers” and MVP iteration discussed in this chapter\n\nCustomer creation, Wilson’s “building the business” stage, should ideally hold the burn rate to $250,000 a month as the company builds a team, expands marketing activities, and starts generating material revenues\n\nThese are guidelines, and there are zillions of exceptions. Assemble all your test results to provide a forecast for the coming year, which begins on Day One of Step 3 of Customer Development, the customer creation process. We doubt there have been many startups where the year-one financial results of customer creation matched the “metrics that matter.” But any VC, uncle or rich neighbor is going to want to know why you think an investment in your startup will deliver startup-size returns. If at the end of this step the numbers are ugly—yup, you guessed it—turn back to the beginning of discovery, or at least customer validation, and start revising and retesting your hypotheses. Three things to consider before you dive into Metrics That Matter:\n\nUse the time frames that make the most sense for your startup. Generally, the longer the physical-channel sales cycle (think enterprise software), the longer the “space” between calculations should be. Here we used a quarter-by-quarter forecast\n\nAn analysis like this can—and should—often stop the pivot–or-proceed process in its tracks if the computation forecasts that the company will either run out of money within the year or won’t be able to raise enough funds to survive the first year of customer creation\n\nDon’t be in a hurry at this critical step. As an entrepreneur, if you take a pile of money to move forward here and fail, it will at least cost you a significant portion of your founders’ equity, and it will often cost you your job\n\nMetrics that Matter Scenarios\n\nMetrics matters are a radically new approach to startup math. They’re best illustrated with a series of examples. The three spreadsheet scenarios on the next pages illustrate how you can use “Metrics that Matter” to evaluate your business. The three examples are:\n\na physical product sold in a physical channel\n\na web/mobile product sold in the web/mobile channel\n\nand a multisided web/mobile market\n\nMetrics that Matter: Example 1\n\n“EZ Gardener” in a Physical Channel\n\nLet’s take a look at Table 6.1 what the metrics that matter for a physical\n\nchannel would look like in spreadsheet form. Here’s a simple example of a rough quarter-by-quarter cash-burn computation for our hypothetical $30 (suggested retail) EZ Gardener all-in- one gardening-tool set, sold in garden stores and by mass merchants. Our timing is the coming year.

A few things about the hypothetical business factored into the numbers\n\nabove:\n\nThis “friends and family” funded venture begins customer creation with $500,000 in the bank. Like most physical-channel marketers, EZ Gardener also promotes online. But they read this book, followed directions, and are “getting the most important channel right first,” so they’re not selling product online yet\n\nIn year two, as the product’s newness wears off, the price drops. Product development was completed earlier offshore, so there are no more development costs until we see how this product sells\n\nRevenue never scales dramatically, since the market type is “re- segmenting/niche market”\n\nWhat Metrics Matter? There are 11 metrics that matter in this spreadsheet. Following the left-hand column of the spreadsheet, let’s explore the origin of each number as well as its source a little more closely:\n\n1. Total number of units sold: This number is estimated (ideally by quarter) from customer validation report cards used with buyers and channel partners. Compare these numbers with your estimates of total addressable (or if known, serviceable) market and your market share estimates. Use the two sets of numbers to estimate the number of units to be sold in each quarter. If customers make multiple purchases within a year, factor it in."

    [
        "2. Average retail selling price: How much the consumer will pay, on average, for the product. This number, developed in the value proposition hypothesis, should be validated in the competitive analysis and throughout customer and channel validation conversations. It’s shown here as the price per unit and is often the average selling price, since retail pricing may vary by channel. 3. Gross sales across all channels: Total retail-dollar sales for the product per quarter. Relatively straightforward to compute, since the company is\n\nusing only one sales channel. Remember to consider “guaranteed sale” situations where retailers can return unsold merchandise for full credit. 4. (Less) channel discount (40%): What percentage of the product’s retail price will the channel take as its cost of sales? Deduct it from the retail price and apply it to all channel revenue as computed in No. 3. We’ve assumed a fairly typical chain-store margin here. This revenue will never reach the company’s coffers, so deduct it now to get to net company revenue. Channels are notorious for charging suppliers for advertising, promotion, and shelf space. 5. (Less) other channel costs: Channels are notorious for charging suppliers for advertising, promotion, and even shelf space. There may also be costs of independent sales reps or brokers who “sell in” merchandise to the channel. In the first year, the company may want to, or be forced to, purchase special promotions in order to get shelf space in an important retail channel. Estimate these costs based on channel-partner discussions."
    ],
    [
        "6. NET COMPANY REVENUE: The net channel revenue (No. 6) is the Gross Sales (No. 3) minus the channel discount (No. 4) and other channel cost (No.5). 7. (Less) sales costs (reps, trade shows): How much does it cost the team to reach the garden product channel cost? In addition to specific customer acquisition costs, the company will spend money on a sales force, sales and marketing materials, attendance at trade shows and more. These costs should be identified in the customer-relationships box and perhaps also in the cost structure box. 8. (Less) product costs: What does it cost to build and make the product? Developed primarily from the value proposition and cost structure boxes, this is an estimate combining two sets of costs:\n\nin this example the cost of developing the product is fully paid for\n\nthe manufacturing cost of the physical product itself\n\n9. (Less) current operating costs: Compute the costs of “turning on the lights” at the company every day, which should be a relatively static number: meager founder salaries, other payroll, rent, equipment, utilities, legal, and the like. This number usually shifts the least, so worry about it less than others."

        "Start with the net company revenue (No. 6) and subtract all the costs beneath it, Nos. 7, 8, and 9. The result of that equation is the “cash burn,” or the reduction in the company’s bank account each quarter. In the example above, the company is losing money, or “burning cash,” until the fourth quarter, when customer growth and reduced product- development costs improve the company’s cash flow quite dramatically. 11. CASH REMAINING: Start by counting the money in the bank on Day One of the quarter. Our hypothetical company began its first year of customer creation with $500,000 in the bank. Reduce it by the quarter’s cash burn to determine how much will be left at quarter’s end. If These Were Your Numbers, What’s a Founder to Do? This is a “nice little business,” and while it will make a lovely living for its founders and a nice return for its investors, it’s hardly a scalable business like the many heroes of Silicon Valley. But even though this company is returning as much pretax profit in year two as it had in the bank on day one of year one, it’s basically going nowhere fast. It’s a one-product company, and the only way it got strong revenue growth was by reducing its retail price—never a good sign. Some things the founders and board should really be discussing:\n\nAre there any potential dramatic changes to the business model that can have significant impact on the company’s future growth prospects? What about overseas markets? Are they a growth opportunity? How can the company capitalize on its one modest success. Are they building a brand enough, and creative enough, to perhaps launch other products both in and beyond the garden area. They might start with “EZWeeder” and “EZhoe” first, and perhaps expand to “EZgrass” or “EZflowers” to take maximum advantage of their brand, credibility and channel relationships to scale the company broader and faster? Can they extend beyond the garden, maybe adding “EZcooker” or “EZcleaner” or “EZcleanup” perhaps? Regardless of the new products, the company would need to spend some serious product development dollars and spend heavily on marketing (especially if moving beyond the garden) with no assurances of further success. (They actually need to develop a whole new set of hypotheses)\n\nUnless the company invests in new product development, this business is more of a hobby than a scalable business\n\nHold these thoughts—and others—for the final section of this phase, the pivot-or-proceed discussion. Next, look at the second of three business models for a software product sold in the web and mobile channels. Metrics that Matter: Example 2\n\nExpense Reporter Sold via Web/mobile Channels\n\nLet’s take a look at Table 6.2, another $30 retail product, downloadable\n\nXpensePro software, sold through the web/mobile channels only. “Metrics That Matter”: Web/Mobile Sales Model (Table 6.2) Note: the leftmost numbers refer to commentary in descriptive text that follows. In this scenario, our hypothetical company is selling XpensePro only as a web or mobile app download directly from its website and via app stores. As in the previous example, things are factored into the numbers above:\n\nProduct-development cost is heavy at first and then declines. Incremental product unit costs are practically zero, since the product is a download\n\nRevenue never scales dramatically, since the market type is “re- segmenting/niche market,” but the year-to-year revenue increases are significant enough to promise downstream success\n\nThis angel-funded business starts with $300,000 cash remaining. More money will be hard to get\n\nWhat Metrics Matter? There are five metrics that matter in this spreadsheet: • Revenue comes from three channels\n\nDirect revenue from web sales, net of acquisition cost Direct mobile sales revenues, after subtracting referral incentives Revenue from the appstore channel, after subtracting channel fees\n\nand marketing costs\n\nCash burned or made during the period • Cash remaining at the end of the quarter\n\nBecause the business is operating in three distinct channels, each of which operates differently, it takes 17 different numbers to create the above five metrics, but the board just needs to focus on five rather than 17. If one’s ever out of whack or way off budget, drill down into the supporting details numbers that make that number up: unit sales, gross direct revenue, cost of customers or sales, and net revenue from the channel. Following the left-hand column of the spreadsheet, let’s explore the origin of each number and its source:\n\nWeb Sales:\n\n1. Direct web unit sales: How many web apps are downloaded from the company’s site. Customers are unlikely to make multiple purchases within a year. 2.

CASH REMAINING: Follow the process in Spreadsheet 1, No. 11. If These Were Your Numbers, What’s a Founder to Do? On the surface, this looks like a really lovely business. It plans to generate $746,000 in positive cash flow in its first year of customer creation, and to roughly triple that cashflow in its second year. But can a business doing $2.5- million in revenue after four years really make investors and founders happy? That’s not for us to decide, and the numbers don’t tell us whether they spent $500,000 and a year—or $5,000,000 and five years—to get to the start of the spreadsheet, so it’s hard to applaud or bash the outcome. Seems like the next board meeting should pull out the latest business model canvas and look for some game-changing growth opportunities, almost no matter what. The company isn’t spending all that much money on product development or staff costs (those numbers are relatively flat), and it’s almost turning into a cash cow long before it should be turned out to pasture. After all, almost any business that can get almost 100,000 new customers in a year should be trying to figure out how to either add a zero to that number in a year or two, or at least double it, perhaps, in the second year. The company’s year two plan seems unambitious at first glance, even though the profits double. Meanwhile, on the downside:\n\nThe $4 incentive (No. 7) might deliver too few sales and need to be beefed up, changing net revenues adversely\n\nApp-store (No.12) approval process could delay launch in the biggest channel, hurting revenues\n\nMore staff (No. 15) might be needed for support, channel relations, or who-knows-what\n\nMobile sales direct to consumers (No. 5) could be a total flop, hurting that revenue\n\nEven though the numbers look pretty good in the spreadsheet, hold the high-fives and look at ways to improve them anyway. After all, they’re still estimates based on customer validation proof—they’re not money in the bank by any means. Review the “what’s a founder to do” section under Spreadsheet 1 to explore ways to reduce the cash burn where it makes sense.

        "“Metrics That Matter”: Multi-sided/Ad-Supported Model (Table 6.3) Note: the leftmost numbers refer to commentary in descriptive text that follows. Metrics that Matter: Example 3\n\nA Multi-sided Market Example\n\nHere’s a third way to look at a totally different business model for the exact same product, XPensePro software. Let’s explore a multi-sided market, where the product is identical but it’s absolutely free to users. Advertisers eager to reach businesspeople with active expense accounts will pay to reach the audience, and company revenues come from advertising and sales of e- mail lists, the other “side” in this multi-sided market example. A multi-sided market, where the product is identical but it’s absolutely free to users. In this scenario, our venture-backed multi-sided market company is offering its products to users for free, provided that they agree to receive two e-mails per week from advertisers. The product is a digital download, but considerable resources are expended selling ads to the other side of the market. (It’s interesting to note how dissimilar these metrics that matter are when compared with the other two business models.) As in the previous example, several things are factored into the numbers above:\n\nOur VC-backed example has a $10-million war chest\n\nProduct-development cost is heavy at first and then declines\n\nProduct costs are practically zero, since the “product” is a download. Revenue never scales dramatically, since the market type is “re- segmenting/niche market,” but the year-to-year revenue increases are significant enough to promise downstream success\n\nMuch of the cost of advertising and e-mail sales is factored into the revenue numbers, which are net of network or rep commission costs\n\nIt still costs real money to acquire users through PR, e-mail, and other activities, even for a free product. As the company iterates and becomes smarter, its acquisition cost declines in the second year\n\nMetrics that Matter/Add It All Up\n\nThere are 16 “metrics that matter” in this spreadsheet because we need to monitor revenue and costs on both sides of the multi-sided market. (The company pivoted and eliminated cash sales of its product in this scenario.) Following the left-hand column of the spreadsheet, let’s explore the origin of each number as well as its source a little more closely:\n\n1. New activated users : How many people will download the free app and begin actively using it. Active is defined as generating at least the average number of page views (No. 4)."

    ],
    [
        "Some will come virally for free, others will cost $6 or more. 3. Total active users: Average active monthly users during the quarter. 4. Average page views per user per quarter: Actual user clicks on the site will generate this number by dividing the number of active users (No. 3) into total page views (No. 5). This is an important measure of the business health and growth. 5. Total page views per quarter: Multiply the total users (No. 3) by the average page views per user (No. 4) to begin to understand available advertising-sales opportunities for the period. 6. Less attrition: Lots of users abandon things they download but don’t have to pay for, so watching this number (generated by instrumentation) is important. We’ve defined attrition as a user who hasn’t generated a page view a week for two consecutive months. 7. TOTAL CPMs to sell: subtract attrition (No. 6) from total page views (No. 5) and divide by 1,000 for the “salable CPMs” needed (ad sales are based on cost per thousand, or CPM). The +/- 7% average gets worse in year two as more competitors emerge. 8. Average CPM x 4 ads/page: Competitive analysis and “buy-side” customer validation research will determine what CPM advertisers are willing to pay to reach this audience. Assuming four ads on each page, multiply the average CPM by 4 to compute the average revenue per 1,000 pages viewed. In this example, we’ve already deducted the cost of sales, whether it’s commissions for sales reps or network ad sales. The CPM increases (Q3-4) as the site gets more attractive to advertisers. 9. TOTAL ADVERTISING REVENUE: multiply the number of M’s (No. 7) or total CPMs available for sale by the 4x average CPM (No. 8) to compute advertising revenue. The figure grows dramatically as the number of users and their site traffic rise. The business model looks so strong and compelling..."

        "If These Were Your Numbers, What’s a founder to do? There’s an old rule in startups that a spreadsheet is worth 48.5x the paper it’s printed on. But if this spreadsheet set of “metrics that matter,” is anywhere close to accurate, our founders and investors at Expensereporter may indeed have a homerun on their hands. In this case, the business model looks so strong and compelling that the founders have two clear priorities. Job #1 is to play strong defense, and make certain that they deliver on all the key numbers in the plan (which, as you recall, are already turned into immutable facts through two grueling stages of Customer Development). That process starts with a step-by-step revalidation of every single number on the page, to be sure there are no mistakes. Next step: a detailed “worst case” analysis. As every business should, the founding team here should expand this one set of metrics into three: a worst case and a high case, on both sides of the hypothetical set of metrics shown here. And since the business is totally dependent on advertising revenue, they should quickly return to their channel validation efforts and probe further to make sure they’re as valid as everyone believes. They should also focus on reducing user attrition. With all that accomplished, review the analyses from Spreadsheets 1 and 2 about reducing costs and optimizing activation and revenue. Then, just in case, put a case of great French Champagne in the office fridge! Some Final Thoughts About the Financial Model\n\nMarket Type Affects Revenue Streams. Each of the four market types has a distinctive sales-growth curve shaped by the degree of difficulty involved in transitioning from sales to the earlyvangelists to sales to mainstream\n\ncustomers. Obviously in new markets, it typically takes considerable time for the product to catch on beyond earlyvangelists, who aren’t typically high- volume mainstream buyers. So success with early sales doesn’t guarantee fast revenue scaling. The sales-growth curves for a new market and an existing market graphically illustrate the difference. Even after finding and successfully selling to earlyvangelists, the rate of sales differs in later years because of the different adoption rates of mainstream customers. Revenue Growth in New and Existing Markets (Figure 6.3)\n\nEstimating revenue in an existing market is relatively simple: Look at the incumbents and calculate the increasing percentage of market share the startup will grab each year. Estimating a new market’s size might seem impossible, since it doesn’t exist yet. What to do? Estimate the opportunity based on proxies and adjacent markets. See if there are any comparable companies. Have others grown as fast as the estimate? Why will this startup perform similarly? Revenue Growth in a Resegmented Market (Figure 6.4)\n\nThe sales curve in a re-segmented market is somewhat easier to estimate. It’s generally similar to that of a new market in that it takes time to gather a head of steam. There are three steps to assessing a re-segmented market: assess the size of the existing market, figure out how large your startup’s “segment” is, and calculate the adoption rate, or the time it will take for that segment to recognize the new product as the solution of choice. Count only the segment that will switch, and beware of long-term contracts, service contracts, and “sunk costs” such as training and installation, all of which are often “lock-ins” or hidden barriers to switching. Revenue growth curves depend on Market Type! Demand Curve Affects Revenue: The “demand curve” seeks the optimum intersection between sales volume and net profit. For example, if a physical product is most efficiently manufactured in lot sizes of 5,000, can that inventory be sold in a reasonable time when current unit sales are 50 a month? A startup selling new electric cars for $29,000 will generate massive demand. But if they cost $45,000 to manufacture, the company will go bankrupt very quickly. Consider:\n\nthe actual price per unit, for multiples, and for subscriptions\n\nhow pricing can be used to attract more users\n\nhow pricing can create larger or more frequent purchases by the same user; volume discounts, free shipping, loyalty points and similar pricing\n\nmechanisms are used for what’s typically called “market basket” optimization\n\nhow pricing can be used to enhance profitability or volume\n\nhow the company can forward-price the product to intersect the economies-of-scale curve (as in, “If we could build 10,000 at a time, our production cost drops 32 percent”)\n\nWhen to Bring in the Accountants\n\nEventually, prospective investors, banks, and others will want to see the traditional P&L, forecast, and more, and that’s fine. Once the metrics that matter are firmly understood to make sound business sense and are validated, almost any finance type (or high school math student) can convert them into a VC-ready multiyear P&L spreadsheet, balance sheet, and cash-flow statement (the “usual stuff” everyone is accustomed to seeing) with ease. On rare and welcome occasions, metrics that matter actually don’t matter at all. If customer acquisition and activation are proceeding at warp speed month after month or the economy is hot, investors may ignore most of the other metrics, throw caution to the wind, and vote to scale the company rapidly. This seldom happens, but we hope it happens to you. It can happen more often in frothy vertical markets, as it did in social networking and other multi-sided markets or strong IPO markets,. But nine times out of 10, the metrics that matter do matter quite a bit when it comes time to spend serious investor dollars. Adding it all up\n\nThis phase is a vital make-or-break analysis of how well the business model should work. But remember that the numbers are still only educated guesses, validated—we hope—through extensive customer discovery and validation effort with scores if not hundreds of customers. Pivot or Proceed: Re-Validate the Business Model\n\nIt’s the perfect time to take one last look at the key business model components, for several reasons. In a few days, a great deal will change if the vote is “go forward” to the customer creation step. Customer creation is a radically different stage during which the company suddenly shifts from “searching for a business model” to “executing one.” It’s no longer celebrating mistakes and wrong turns. It shifts full-throttle into “execute” mode, with revenue targets and timetables to hit, product and plans to deliver, and more granular and precise accountability to investors and board members. The company is about to spend a great deal of money far faster, and irrevocably, as it works ambitiously to deliver its chosen business model. With that comes the typical “career risk” for founders, which always prompts investors to ask if the seemingly manic “founder type” should be replaced by a “seasoned” leader with proven execution skills. Massive amounts of money are about to be spent on a single, focused bet that the business model, as developed, has a high likelihood of scaling to profit and success. Boards and investors are suddenly less forgiving and typically far less welcoming of reports like “That idea was wrong” and “That didn’t work as we hoped” than they were during the earlier “search” phases. Long story short, it’s time to revisit the core business model elements\n\none last time. Best Bets\n\nYou’re almost done. You’ve run the numbers in the last section and are still feeling like your business is a winner. But have you picked the best value proposition? Is your product delivery schedule right? Are you confident you’ve gotten the optimum revenue model and costs? And have you missed any best moves on the overall business model? Here are a few last things to check. Make Sure the Value Proposition is Right\n\nAfter going through the “metrics that matter” in the last section, are you absolutely convinced you have the right value proposition? You’re about to live with it for awhile."
    ],
    [
        "If you don’t feel that it’s going to win the marketplace now, it doesn’t get better over time. It may be time to reconfigure, repackage or unbundle the product. This requires a loop all the way back to customer discovery. Once there, use the core technology to develop another product, configuration, distribution method or price and then modify product presentations and return to Phase 3 (product presentation) and do it again. Yes, it hurts, but it hurts far less than failure. Make Sure the Product Delivery is Right\n\nEven with selling success, check the product delivery timing with the product-development team. Schedules inevitably change, seldom for the better. Can the company still deliver what was just sold and do so as promised, or was the sale actually vaporware? If vaporware, at best the company secured a few pilot projects. Continuing to sell as if nothing has changed is a bad idea. As schedules slip, hard-won earlyvangelists weaken, and references evaporate quickly. The good news is, if this happens (it happens often), the situation is still recoverable."
    ],
    [
        "There aren’t many people to fire, and the burn rate is low. (As discussed earlier, it’s always important to have enough cash to get this phase wrong at least once.) The solution is to shut down any additional selling for a while, admit mistakes, and turn pilot projects into something useful—first for the customer and then as a marketable product. Make Sure the Revenue is High and Costs are Low\n\nThere’s nothing worse than leaving money on the table or spending more than you needed to. The best way to answer these questions and more is to “walk” slowly through the business model one more time. Start with the value proposition. Are there too many features or not\n\nenough variety? Would a lower price sell far more units or sell the same number at a lower acquisition cost? What if the product were free, or free to those bringing three or five or 10 other customers along? In the customer-relationships hypothesis, is there rock-solid confidence in the plan, or might a freemium or multi-sided alternative deliver bolder, faster growth? Will that costly AdWords effort deliver the planned result? Can a different channel deliver fewer sales and more profit? Will partners deliver the revenue growth you need and expect? Are there higher level business model patterns you may have missed? Make Sure Your Business Model is Right\n\nGrab a fresh business model canvas and a pack of Post-it notes. Explore alternatives seriously. The team is about to put a big pile of chips, probably millions, on “red” or “black,” as in “pass” or “fail.” Is everyone confident the choice is the right? Changing direction at this juncture is a bold move indeed. It’s not what the investors expected, especially after a long, grueling process of customer discovery and validation. Then again, bold moves are the work of great entrepreneurs. And even though a pivot at this point leads to more customer validation and more time, it’s far better to pivot now than to forge ahead at full speed and full spend if it’s possible that there’s a better idea out there somewhere. Further validate the business model, not just looking for enhancements in revenue opportunity and places to reduce cost, but looking for “game changers.” Can you change a product sold by features into a branded- experience that becomes a “got-to-have-it” fashion? Can you change a revenue model from a unit sale into a network effects model? Look for the non-obvious business patterns."

    [
        "Even if the team is certain the current model is the best way forward, now’s the time to bring in your advisory board and have them throw stones (painful as it is) at your canvas. Do they see a huge move that you missed? No doubt the financial model review just completed raised at least a handful of questions and perhaps pointed to some opportunities. Revisit the business model checklist questions. Are any of the\n\nanswers different? Does the team want to have more money in the bank or spend less? Where can savings be effected or additional dollars efficiently put to good? If the team has turned over every possibility in its review, looking both at radical changes and modest improvements in the business model, and confidence still carries the day, it’s time to move on to the ultimate question: pivot or proceed? The Toughest Startup Question: Pivot or Proceed? This is the moment of truth when the team and the investors will vote on whether to begin spending massive amounts of money to execute the business model. To vote honestly, the team needs to take a hard, honest look at the pivot-or-proceed analyses developed in this phase. As grueling as the customer validation process is, it’s quite likely that the company will require another turn of the wheel before everyone can enthusiastically vote to move forward. Don’t despair—this need to pivot arises almost every time, and often calls for a return all the way to customer discovery. Hubris is the evil twin of a passionate entrepreneur. The alternative is even more painful."

It’s time to reflect, thinking seriously about the company’s genuine chances for scalable, profitable success. It’s a hard decision, particularly for self-confident entrepreneurs who pride themselves on their tenacity, and problem-solving abilities. “I’m an entrepreneur. I make things happen against all odds” just doesn’t cut it when staring at the hard facts and statistics. Don’t confuse hubris with passion or facts. Did validation really convert opinions to facts, or is everyone just\n\nmoving the goalposts to reach customer creation? The next step seriously cranks up the company’s cash burn rate, sharply diminishing if not extinguishing available cash or runway."

        "Did the product sell well and easily? Is it absolutely, unequivocally clear that when more money is spent to acquire customers, they’ll arrive at a steady, predictable, profitable pace? This question in particular probably sends 90 percent of startups back into the depths of Customer Development to refine and retest components of the business model. If the “ramp” to more customers, revenue and profits isn’t proved to be predictable in test results, it’s also a reason to pivot. Using everything you learned in customer validation, go back to Phase 1 of this step (get ready to sell) and try it again. Sorry. This isn’t easy to do. If everything checks out (again, it seldom does the first time around), the end of customer validation is a major milestone. Customer problems are understood, a set of earlyvangelists has been found, and the company has delivered a product its customers want to buy, developed a repeatable and scalable sales process, and demonstrated a profitable business model. Hopefully, all the learning is captured in writing and the business model diagram is updated. Fund-raising, while never easy, will be far easier than at this point than it was before. When you’ve answered “yes” to that taxing list of questions, you deserve a night off, if not a week. Congratulations! The company is prepared to move full speed ahead to the customer creation process. What’s Next? The first two steps of Customer Development are where entrepreneurs live or die in the search for a repeatable and scalable business model. When a company has successfully exited Customer Validation, there’s a library full of business-building texts available to help execute the business model. So, at least for now, if you’re eager to execute the next two steps—Customer Creation and Company Building—return to the original Four Steps to the Epiphany, or turn to a more targeted text for fine-tuned support.

The founders’ job is to translate this vision and these hypotheses into facts. Facts live outside the building, where future customers (prospects, really) live and work, so that’s where you need to go. Nothing is more fundamental to Customer Development, and nothing is harder to do. It’s much easier to write code, build hardware, have meetings and write reports than it is to find and listen to potential customers. But that’s what separates the winners from the losers. Facts live outside the building, where future customers live and work... In Customer Development, the founders gather firsthand experience about every component of the business model. The team can support the founders, but firsthand experience by definition cannot be delegated. This customer research must be done by founders because:\n\nKey customer feedback points are random, unpredictable, and often painful to hear. Employees hate to deliver bad news to higher-ups\n\nEmployees have far less at stake and seldom listen as acutely, and they don’t get heard adequately when they report back. It’s too easy to dismiss their findings as “hearsay” or to ignore critical points of feedback\n\nConsultants have even less at stake than employees and often color their commentary to either tell the client what he wants to hear or deliver messages that can lead to extended consulting relationships. This is also second- or third-hand feedback and too diluted or diffused to provide value\n\nOnly a founder can embrace the feedback, react to it, and adeptly make\n\nthe decisions necessary to change or pivot key business model components. Rule No. 2:\n\nPair Customer Development with Agile Development\n\nCustomer Development is useless unless the product development organization can iterate the product with speed and agility. Customer Development the product development is useless unless organization can iterate the product with speed and agility. If Engineering builds the product using waterfall development, it will be deaf, dumb and blind to customer input except during a short period when it’s specifying the\n\nproduct. The rest of the time, engineers are locked into an implementation cycle, unable to change the product features without intolerable delay. By contrast, a startup engineering organization using an agile methodology is designed to continually take customer input and deliver a product that iterates readily around an MVP or its minimum feature set. In this book, agile engineering/development refers to the rapid deployment, iterative development and continuous discovery processes that hardware or software companies can use. We don’t advocate any particular flavor, just its necessity. The Customer Development process provides the continuous customer input to make agile work. Before the company even starts, the founders need to reach a deep and\n\ninexorable commitment to the customer/agile development partnership."

Failures in an existing company are an exception. They happen when someone screws up. In a startup, you’re searching, not executing, and the only way to find the right path is to try lots of experiments and take a lot of wrong turns. Failure is part of the process. If you’re afraid to fail in a startup, you’re destined to do so. Failures are not truly failures, per se but an integral part of the startup learning process. You’ll be running dozens if not hundreds of pass/fail tests —on your pitch, your features, your pricing, and on and on—so get ready to accept failure and move on. When something isn’t working, successful founders orient themselves to the new facts, decide what needs fixing, and act decisively. The Customer Development process demands frequent, agile iteration,\n\nfollowed, of course, by testing of the iteration that often leads to another iteration or pivot, which leads to more testing and... If you’re afraid to fail in a startup, you’re destined to do so. Rule No. 4:\n\nMake Continuous Iterations and Pivots\n\nThe strategy of embracing failure in Customer Development demands frequent, agile iteration and pivots. A pivot is a substantive change in one or more of the nine boxes of the business model canvas. (For example, a pricing change from freemium to subscription model or a customer segment shift from boys 12-15 years old to women 45-60.) Or it can be more complex, such as a change of target customer or user. Iterations, meanwhile, are minor changes to business model components (e.g., changing pricing from $99 to $79). Groupon’s legendary $12 billion pivot is a perfect example. When a company is limping along, only a dramatic change to one or more business model components can get it back on the road to success. Groupon’s legendary $12 billion pivot (their IPO valuation) is a perfect example. Groupon was started from a company called the Point. It was struggling, at best, as a social media platform working to get people together to solve problems, but was about to run out of money. The most effective campaigns on The Point were those that saved people money by grouping or bundling their purchases. The founders started blogging various deals from different businesses each day. They called this, “Get Your Groupon.com.” Groupon’s first offer hit in October of 2008: buy two pizzas for the price of one in the shop on the first floor of its Chicago headquarters. Twenty people bought the deal and the company was well on its way to its $12-billion pivot. Pivots are driven by the learnings and insight from a continuous stream\n\nof “pass/fail” tests you run throughout discovery and validation. The best startup founders don’t hesitate to make the change."

The difference between a static business plan and a dynamic business model could well be the difference between a flameout and success.

In this book, Alexander Osterwalder’s business model canvas serves as the scorecard for the customer discovery process described in Step One. Osterwalder’s book Business Model Generation (Wiley, 2010) provides the structure for the canvas. Business Model Canvas (Figure 1.1)\n\nAs a startup moves through the Customer Development process, it will use the business model canvas as a scorecard, by posting the hypotheses\n\nabout each component of the model and then revising the hypotheses as the founders gather facts. Think of your first version of the business model canvas as the starting point showing the hypotheses that must be confirmed in face-to-face or online interaction with customers. More often than not, the customers will reject components of the business model, saying, “I’d rather buy that from a retailer,” or, “The product needs to have these features to be important to me.” As customers approve or dispute the business model hypotheses, the company either accepts the customers’ approval or pivots to change its business model to better target the opportunity. Using the business model canvas as a guide makes it easier to figure out where and how to pivot, since the team can visually diagram its alternatives and see what it needs to change. Each time the founders iterate or pivot (see Rule No. 4) in response to customer feedback, they draw a new canvas showing the changes. Over time, these multiple canvases form a “flip book” that shows the evolution of the business model. Agile startups can end up with a six-inch-thick stack of business model diagrams they can burn at the IPO-celebration bonfire.

        "7:\n\nAgree on Market Type. It Changes Everything\n\nOne of the radical insights guiding this book is that not all startups are alike. One of the key ways in which they are different is in the relationship between a startup’s new product and its market. These product/market relationships generally fit one of these descriptions:\n\nbringing a new product into an existing market\n\nbringing a new product into a new market\n\nbringing a new product into an existing market and trying to:\n\nre-segment that market as a low-cost entrant or\n\nre-segment that market as a niche entrant\n\ncloning a business model that’s successful in another country\n\nWhat confused entrepreneurs for decades is that the traditional product introduction model works when introducing a product into an existing market with a known business model (i.e., known customers, channels and markets). However, since the majority of startups are not pursuing known markets (those in new or re-segmented categories), they don’t really know who their customers will be. These types of startups are searching for a repeatable and scalable business model. Market type influences everything a company does. Market type influences everything a company does. Strategy and tactics that work for one market type seldom work for another. Market type determines the startup’s customer feedback and acquisition activities and spending. It changes customer needs, adoption rates, product features and\n\npositioning as well as its launch strategies, channels and activities. In sum, different market types require dramatically different discovery, MVPs, and sales and marketing strategies. In existing markets, where customers exist, marketing is relatively easy: users can describe the market and the attributes that matter the most to them. The new product or service typically runs faster, does something better or cheaper, or otherwise improves on a customer-defined attribute. Users, the market, and competitors are known, and competition involves comparing the product and its features with others. In a new market, a company lets customers do something they couldn’t do before by creating something that never existed before. Or it dramatically lowers costs to create a new class of users. By definition, new markets have no customers yet, so there’s nobody to know what the product can do or why they should buy. This makes getting feedback and creating demand particularly challenging, since the product is unknown to users and the market is undefined and unknown, and costly to develop. The key isn’t competing, but instead understanding whether a large customer base exists and whether customers can be persuaded to buy. A classic founder error in a new market is the “fast-burn” spending of sales and marketing funds, a practice that may be appropriate when selling to existing customers in a known market, but makes no sense in a new market. The new- vs.-existing axis is at the core of the market-type definition. Re-segmenting an existing market is useful when the incumbent is too difficult to attack head-on (like Amazon, Facebook, or Microsoft). A re- segmentation strategy is based on the startup’s market and customer knowledge, ideally identifying a market opportunity that incumbents are missing, which usually takes one of two forms: a low-cost strategy or a niche strategy. (Unlike differentiation, segmentation forges a distinct spot in customers’ minds that is unique, valuable, and in demand.)\n\nLow-cost re-segmentation is just what it sounds like. Are there customers at the low end of an existing market who will buy “good enough” performance at a substantially lower price? Niche re-segmentation looks at an existing market and asks whether some segment of this market would buy a new product designed to address more specific needs. Can some sizable portion of the market be convinced that a characteristic of the new product is radical enough to change the rules\n\nand shape of an existing market. See Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne’s work on “Blue Ocean Strategy” for another way to think of re-segmenting a market. Cloning an existing business model is a powerful technique when an existing business has been proven in one country but has not yet been introduced in another. Startups in Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Japan and China (each with its own large local market and language and cultural barriers) can adopt, borrow, or copy a successful American business model and customize it for local language and buying preferences. (Soon ideas from those countries will be cloned in the U.S.)\n\nFor example, Baidu in China and Yandex in Russia are the equivalent of Google in their respective markets. And Qzone, RenRen, PengYou and Kaixin are the Facebooks of China, while Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki play the same role in Russia. Startup companies generally enter one of these four market types and ultimately must commit to one. The consequences of a wrong market-type choice will prove to be severe in the customer creation stage. While market type is ultimately a “late-binding decision,” a working hypothesis helps frame early customer discovery issues. Market-type decision-making is explored in greater detail in Chapter 2. ...the few financial metrics to track: cash-burn rate, number of months’ worth of cash left... Rule No. 8:\n\nStartup Metrics Differ from Those in Existing Companies\n\nWe now have several centuries’ worth of performance metrics for existing businesses—P&Ls balance sheets, cash-flow forecasts and line-of-business analyses, plus scores of others. Here’s hoping your startup becomes big enough to need them someday. In the past (not so long ago), we used these\n\ntools with startups because we didn’t know what else to measure. We now know that startup metrics should focus on tracking the startup’s progress converting guesses and hypotheses into incontrovertible facts rather than measuring the execution of a static plan. It’s critical that board and management continuously test and measure each hypothesis until the entire business model is worth scaling into a company. If the company is venture-backed, management and investors must agree on a set of metrics that truly matter and work toward a report or “dashboard” that essentially replaces the P&L, cash flow, and balance sheet as centerpieces of early board meetings. Startup metrics track the results of pass/fail tests and the iterations they lead to:\n\nHave the customer problem and product features been validated? Does the minimum feature set resonate with customers? Who in fact is the customer, and have initial customer-related hypotheses on the likes of value proposition, customer segments, and channels been validated through face-to-face customer interaction? Customer-validation questions might include: average order size, customer lifetime value, average time to first order, rate of sales pipeline growth, improvement in close rate, and revenue per salesperson. In addition to the startup metrics above, the relatively few financial metrics that a startup board should be tracking are cash-burn rate, number of months’ worth of cash left, short-term hiring plans, and amount of time until the company reaches cash-flow break-even. Make sure decisions are fact-based, not faith-based."

        "Rule No. 9:\n\nFast Decision-Making, Cycle Time, Speed and Tempo\n\nSpeed matters at startups where the only absolute certainty is that the bank balance declines every day. While Rule No. 4 addresses iterations and pivots, it doesn’t specify how long they should take. Unequivocally, the faster the better, since the faster these “learn, build, pivot” or “iterate, build” cycles happen, the greater the odds of finding a scalable business model with the cash on hand. If cycles happen too slowly, the startup runs out of cash and dies. The biggest impediment to cycle time is psychological: it requires the admission of being wrong or even of suffering a short-term tactical defeat. While pivots and iterations are about speed outside the building, speed also matters inside the company. Most startup decisions are made in the face of uncertainty. There’s seldom a clear-cut, perfect solution to any engineering, customer or competitor problem, and founders shouldn’t agonize over trying to find one. This doesn’t mean gambling with the company’s fortunes on a whim. It means adopting plans with an acceptable degree of risk and doing so quickly. (Make sure these decisions are fact- based, not faith-based.) In general, the company that consistently makes and implements decisions rapidly gains a tremendous, often-decisive competitive advantage. ...startups should make reversible decisions before anyone leaves the CEO’s office. Startup decisions have two states: reversible and irreversible. A reversible decision could be adding or dropping a product feature or a new algorithm in the code or targeting a specific set of customers. If the decision proves a bad one, it can be unwound in a reasonable period of time. An irreversible decision such as firing an employee, launching a product, or signing a long lease on expensive office space is usually difficult or impossible to reverse. Startups should as policy, make reversible decisions before anyone leaves the CEO’s office or before a meeting ends. Perfect decision-making is both unimportant and impossible, and what matters more is forward momentum and a tight, fact-based feedback loop to quickly recognize and reverse bad decisions. By the time a big company gets the committee to get the subcommittee to pick a meeting date, most startups have made 20 decisions, reversed five, and implemented the other 15. Learning to make decisions quickly is just part of the equation. Agile startups have mastered another trick: tempo—the ability to make quick decisions consistently and at all levels in the company. Speed and tempo are integral parts of startup DNA, and a great startup’s tempo is often 10 times that of a large company. Rule No."

Later, as the startup moves into customer validation, the team may grow to include a dedicated “sales closer” responsible for the logistics of getting early orders signed. The closer shouldn’t be confused with a traditional sales VP. To succeed in this process, the team must have:\n\nthe ability to listen to customer objections and understand whether they are issues about the product, the presentation, the pricing or something else (or the wrong type of customer)\n\nexperience in talking to and moving between customers and engineers\n\nconfidence amid a state of constant change, often operating “without a map”\n\nthe ability to walk in their customers’ shoes, understanding how they work and the problems they face\n\nSome would say this checklist isn’t bad for identifying great entrepreneurs.

The goal of Customer Development is not to avoid spending money but to preserve cash while searching for the repeatable and scalable business model. Once found, then spend like there’s no tomorrow. This paragraph is worth deconstructing:\n\nPreserve cash: When a startup has unlimited cash (Internet bubbles, frothy venture climate), it can iterate on its mistakes by burning more dollars. When money is tight, without dollars to redo mistakes, it’s crucial to minimize waste. The Customer Development process preserves cash by not hiring any sales and marketing staff until the founders turn hypotheses into facts and discover a viable product/market fit. While searching: Customer Development observes that at the start, the company and its business model are based solely on hypotheses, not facts, and that the founders need to get out of the building to turn these hypotheses into customer data. This “get out of the building” approach, combined with rapid iteration and pivots, is central to the model’s customer discovery and validation steps. ...preserve cash while searching for the repeatable and scalable business model...

        "Rule No. 14:\n\nCustomer Development Success Begins With Buy- In\n\nCustomer Development’s “learning and discovery” philosophy can be immensely disorienting to a founder, engineer or investor who has spent his or her career executing a plan. For Customer Development to succeed, everyone on the team—from investor or parent company to engineers, marketeers and founders—needs to understand and agree that the Customer Development process is different to its core. If the engineering VP is talking waterfall development or the board demands a rigid timetable, Customer Development is destined for disaster. Everyone must accept the process, recognizing that this is a fluid, nonlinear search for a business model that can sometimes last for years. The Customer Development process is different to its core. Customer Development changes almost every aspect of startup behavior,\n\nperformance, metrics, and, as often as not, success potential. It’s not just a “nice to do” while executing the revenue model in the back of the business plan. Customer Development reinvents the business model on the fly, iterating often and pivoting whenever indicated. Founders need to have the commitment of the team and board before embarking on Customer Development. Ensure that all understand and agree that it’s iterative, necessary, and worthwhile and that it changes the benchmarks and metrics along the way. Comments such as “The product is already spec’ed, and we can’t change the features since development is already underway,” or “We already have the factory (or sales team or marketing materials) built,” or “We have to launch to make the numbers in the plan,” are all red flags. To succeed at Customer Development, the company must abandon the old model’s emphasis on execution of a fantasy business plan. Instead it must commit to a Customer Development process stressing learning, discovery, failure, and iteration in the search for a successful business model. If you’re ready for this process, this book will tell you how to do it. Summary: The Customer Development Process\n\nThe Customer Development process reflects the best practices of winning startups. It is the only approach for web-based businesses where failure is certain without constant customer feedback and product iteration as they search for their audiences. Customer Development’s fast cycle times and inherent cash conservation gives all entrepreneurs more chances to pivot, iterate, and succeed before the bank account runs dry. Describe this model to entrepreneurs who have taken companies all the way to a lucrative exit and beyond, and heads nod in recognition. While each step has its own specific objectives, the process as a whole has one overarching goal: discovering the repeatable, scalable, and ultimately profitable business before running out of cash. This transforms the company from a set of founding hypotheses into a moneymaking endeavor. Customer Development is damn hard work. You can’t fake it. Customer Development is damn hard work.
